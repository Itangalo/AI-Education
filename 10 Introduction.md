# 1: What is ChatGPT?

At first glance, ChatGPT is a chat window where you type messages to a chatbot, which responds. However, there are several things that make ChatGPT special. The first is that it writes in a human-like manner - it follows the conversation, writes sensible things and is generally friendly. The second thing that makes ChatGPT special is that it has a lot of knowledge about specific subjects: you can ask about the history of model railroads, what is required for growing potatoes effectively, or what distinguishes schottis as a dance, and ChatGPT will respond in a clear and trustworthy way.

ChatGPT is powered by an AI model that has been trained on large parts of the text that was available on the internet until 2021. It's more text than a human could read in a lifetime - actually so much that it would require 57 billion human lifetimes to read through it all [^1]. The text is the starting point for the answers that ChatGPT provides, but the answers are not looked up or copied from what the AI model has read. Instead, the text mass has been used to distill patterns for how text and words tend to be related. Based on this, ChatGPT makes guesses on which words would fit well to write, and the same question will often result in slightly different answers if asked multiple times. (More information about ChatGPT can be found in Chapter 12.)

This book contains many excerpts from conversations with ChatGPT. They are usually word-for-word representations - what you are reading is what the conversation with ChatGPT looked like. The bold text is the question (the "prompt") from the user, the rest is the AI's response. In some cases, the text has been lightly edited for better formatting in book form, and in some cases, larger amounts of text in the question have been replaced by a short description within square brackets.
