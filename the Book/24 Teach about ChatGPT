# 5: Teach About ChatGPT
Tools similar to ChatGPT have existed for several years and are used in various digital services. ChatGPT provides better answers than previous tools, but a significant difference is also that the interface makes the technology accessible to the masses. Everything points to the technology continuing to develop, and becoming more and more accessible. It is therefore also reasonable for students to have the chance to learn about what tools like ChatGPT can do - and the need to use them judiciously.

## Discuss Values and Other Non-Explicit Messages
Answers from ChatGPT can be excellent for allowing students to discuss any biases in values or perspectives that may be hidden in the text: What assumptions has the AI made? What type of culture does it seem to be based on? Are there aspects of the answer that exclude or diminish certain groups of people? What type of values are hidden beneath the surface?

It can also be valuable to discuss what happens if one or a few senders have a large influence on answers to questions asked by people. Does this differ from how Google and a few social platforms dominate the information world today? How so, or why not?

**When you read the four conversations, think about:**
* Does ChatGPT seem to give different recommendations to the teenagers with different backgrounds?
* In what school subjects do discussions of biased messages belong? Where or how could such discussions fit into your teaching?

In the examples below, the first four prompts are deliberately paired identically.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* Are important but potentially controversial things omitted in the answer?
* Donald Trump is a polarizing topic. Does ChatGPT provide an answer that most people can agree with? Is it desirable?
* Are there controversial or polarizing issues in what you are teaching about?

> **Can you describe how it was that Donald Trump became the president of the United States? I would like to know more about the background to this event.**
>
> Donald J. Trump was elected as the 45th President of the United States after winning the 2016 Presidential Election. He won the election as the Republican Party candidate with 306 electoral votes, while his opponent Hillary Clinton of the Democratic Party received 227 electoral votes. Prior to entering politics, Trump was a businessman and television personality, having gained notoriety as the host of "The Apprentice" reality show. His political campaign was marked by controversial statements and actions, including calls to build a wall along the US-Mexico border and implement strict immigration policies. Despite these controversial statements, Trump was able to mobilize a significant portion of the American electorate, particularly among white, rural, and working-class voters who felt left behind by the political establishment.
>
> **Can you tell me more?**
>
> Sure. Trump's presidential campaign was marked by a focus on nationalism, populism, and a rejection of political correctness. He promised to "Make America Great Again" by bringing back jobs, reducing immigration, and restoring law and order. He also promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and to cut taxes for individuals and businesses. Trump's unconventional approach to politics, combined with his celebrity status, earned him a large and dedicated following, which helped him win the election despite receiving fewer popular votes than Clinton.
>
> During his presidency, Trump continued to make headlines with his controversial statements and actions, including a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, a trade war with China, and his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. He was impeached twice by the House of Representatives, first for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in December 2019, and then for incitement of insurrection after the storming of the US Capitol building on January 6, 2021. However, he was acquitted both times by the Senate.
>
> Overall, Trump's presidency was marked by significant polarization and division within the country, and his legacy continues to be a source of debate and discussion in the United States and around the world.

## Practicing Information Review

**When you read the conversations, consider:**
* What tools are available for reviewing information?
* What claims are important to review, and which ones can you possibly leave unverified?
* Are there several correct answers? What are the consequences of ChatGPT choosing a certain answer?
