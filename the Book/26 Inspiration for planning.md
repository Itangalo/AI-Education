# 6: Inspiration for Planning
One of ChatGPT's strongest branches is to provide ideas and inspiration. You can ask for ten ideas and choose the ones that feel worth pursuing, or ask for ten more with a slightly different question if none of the answers fit well. This can be a useful tool when planning lessons, courses or areas of study.

## Inspiration for Planning Setups
When asking ChatGPT for planning suggestions, it is particularly important to be aware of pedagogical pitfalls: ChatGPT does not take the Swedish school's governance documents as a starting point and does not know the conditions in your class or group - unless you tell it. The answers from ChatGPT can provide inspiration, even if they are not exactly right.

**When reading the conversations, consider:**
* Would you like support with planning drafts? Why, or why not?
* Do the suggestions from ChatGPT seem useful and pedagogically well thought out?
* What assumptions does ChatGPT make about the forms of teaching? Does it match how you usually teach? If not, are there things you can and want to adopt?
* Feel free to try asking for planning drafts for larger or smaller parts of your teaching yourself. You will probably get better answers if you provide detailed descriptions of the conditions or what type of planning you want.
