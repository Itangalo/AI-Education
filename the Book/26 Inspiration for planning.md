# 6: Inspiration for Planning
One of ChatGPT's strongest branches is to provide ideas and inspiration. You can ask for ten ideas and choose the ones that feel worth pursuing, or ask for ten more with a slightly different question if none of the answers fit well. This can be a useful tool when planning lessons, courses or areas of study.

## Inspiration for Planning Setups
When asking ChatGPT for planning suggestions, it is particularly important to be aware of pedagogical pitfalls: ChatGPT does not take the Swedish school's governance documents as a starting point and does not know the conditions in your class or group - unless you tell it. The answers from ChatGPT can provide inspiration, even if they are not exactly right.

**When reading the conversations, consider:**
* Would you like support with planning drafts? Why, or why not?
* Do the suggestions from ChatGPT seem useful and pedagogically well thought out?
* What assumptions does ChatGPT make about the forms of teaching? Does it match how you usually teach? If not, are there things you can and want to adopt?
* Feel free to try asking for planning drafts for larger or smaller parts of your teaching yourself. You will probably get better answers if you provide detailed descriptions of the conditions or what type of planning you want.

> **Starting a new area with my 8th grade class today: the ancient world. I only have four lessons for this area. Can you give me some suggestions on how to lay out these lessons?**
>  
> Hello! It sounds like you have a challenge on your hands to cover as much about the ancient world as possible in just four lessons. Here are some suggestions on how you could lay out the lessons:
>  
> 1. Introduction to the ancient world: Start by giving the students an overview of what the ancient world means and where in the world this period of history took place. You can also talk about important events and people from this time.
> 2. Greek gods and myths: A large part of the ancient world is about Greek gods and myths. Give the students an insight into the Greek mythology and talk about important gods and myths, such as Odysseus and his travels, or the Greek goddess Athena.
> 3. The Roman Empire: The Roman Empire was another important culture during the ancient world. Give the students an overview of Roman history and talk about important events and people, such as Julius Caesar and Constantine the Great.
> 4. Culture and society in the ancient world: End the lessons by focusing on culture and society in the ancient world. Talk about what people ate, how they lived, how they dressed and what different social classes there were. You can also compare and contrast different cultures during the ancient world, such as Greeks and Romans.
> 
> There's of course much more to say about the ancient world, but with four lessons, you can cover the most important aspects and give the students a good foundation to build upon. Don't forget to use different learning styles and methods to keep the students engaged, such as group work, discussions, and practical activities. Also, be sure to include visual aids such as images and maps to make the material more lively.
>  
> **Those are not bad requirements. Can you give suggestions for practical activities that would fit?**
>  
> Here are some suggestions for practical activities that could be appropriate for teaching about the ancient world:
> 
> 1. Gods and myths: Have the students create their own Greek gods and myths. They can, for example, draw pictures of their gods and write a short story about their gods and myths.
> 2. Roman city plans: Have the students create a model of a Roman city. They can use clay or paper and pencil to create houses, temples, the forum, and other important buildings.
> 3. Costumes and outfits: Have the students create costumes and outfits that can be worn during the ancient world. They can use different materials such as paper, fabric, beads, and other decorations.
> 4. Role-playing: Have the students play different roles from the ancient world, such as Greek gods, Roman soldiers, or slaves. They can use scripts and props to bring the roles to life.
