# 6: Inspiration for Planning
One of the things ChatGPT really excels at is providing ideas and inspiration. You can ask for ten ideas and choose the ones that feel worth pursuing, or ask for ten more with a slightly different question if none of the first answers fits what you’re looking for. This can be a useful tool when planning lessons, courses or particular areas for teaching.

## Inspiration for Lesson Plans
When asking ChatGPT for planning suggestions, it is particularly important to be aware of pedagogical pitfalls: ChatGPT does not use your country’s curricula as a starting point and does not know the conditions in your class or group – unless you tell it. Still, the answers from ChatGPT can provide inspiration even if they are not spot-on.

**When reading the conversations, consider:**
* Would you like support with drafting lesson plans? Why, or why not?
* Do the suggestions from ChatGPT seem useful and pedagogically sound?
* What assumptions does ChatGPT make about the forms of teaching? Does it match how you usually teach? If not, are there things you can and want to adopt?
* Feel free to try asking for drafts for lesson plans for things you yourself are teaching. You will probably get better answers if you provide detailed descriptions of the conditions or what type of plans you would like to have.

> **I’m starting a new area with my 8th grade class today: the ancient world. I only have four lessons for this area. Can you give me some suggestions on how to lay out these lessons?**
>  
> Hello! It sounds like you have a challenge on your hands to cover as much about the ancient world as possible in just four lessons. Here are some suggestions on how you could lay out the lessons:
>  
> 1. Introduction to the ancient world: Start by giving the students an overview of what the ancient world means and where in the world this period of history took place. You can also talk about important events and people from this time.
> 2. Greek gods and myths: A large part of the ancient world concerns Greek gods and myths. Give the students an insight into the Greek mythology and talk about important gods and myths, such as Odysseus and his travels, or the Greek goddess Athena.
> 3. The Roman Empire: The Roman Empire was another important culture during the ancient world. Give the students an overview of Roman history and talk about important events and people, such as Julius Caesar and Constantine the Great.
> 4. Culture and society in the ancient world: End the lessons by focusing on culture and society in the ancient world. Talk about what people ate, how they lived, how they dressed and what different social classes there were. You can also compare and contrast different cultures during the ancient world, such as Greeks and Romans.
> 
> There's of course much more to say about the ancient world, but with four lessons, you can cover the most important aspects and give the students a good foundation to build upon. Don't forget to use different learning styles and methods to keep the students engaged, such as group work, discussions, and practical activities. Also, be sure to include visual aids such as images and maps to make the material more lively.
>  
> **Those are quite some demands. Can you give suggestions for practical activities that would fit?**
>  
> Here are some suggestions for practical activities that might be suitable for use when teaching about ancient times:
> 
> 1. Gods and myths: Have the students create their own Greek gods and myths. They can, for example, draw pictures of their gods and write a short story about their gods and myths.
> 2. Roman city plans: Have the students create a model of a Roman city. They can use clay or paper and pen to create houses, temples, the forum and other important buildings.
> 3. Costumes and attire: Have the students create costumes and attire that could have be worn during ancient times. They can use different materials such as paper, fabric, beads, and other decorations.
> 4. Role-playing: Have the students play different roles from ancient times, for example Greek gods, Roman soldiers, or slaves. They can use costumes and accessories to make the role-playing more realistic.
> 5. Practical experiments: Have the students carry out practical experiments that demonstrate, for example, how to create vases or mosaics. They can also experiment with different types of food and cooking techniques that were used during ancient times.
> 
> There are many different ways to make teaching about ancient times more practical and hands-on. Feel free to combine different activities to keep the students engaged and to give them different ways to learn. Don't forget to give the students clear instructions and guidance, and make sure the activities are appropriate for their age and abilities.

> **I'm going to teach systems of linear equations for students taking the social sciences program. I have a total of three lessons for the topic, with 60 minutes per lesson. Afterwards, I want them to be able to use linear equation systems to describe realistic situations and have a reasonable confidence in solving linear equation systems (preferably with more than one method). Many of the students feel uncertain when it comes to algebra and arithmetics, and several students think that math is boring. It is therefore important that the students feel that they are learning things and succeeding, and I want the teaching to be engaging. Do you have suggestions for the setup of the three lessons?**
> 
> For the students to feel that they are learning things and succeeding, and for the teaching to be engaging, the following setup for the three lessons may be appropriate:
> 
> Lesson 1: Introduction to systems of linear equations and graphical solution. Start by giving the students an overall understanding of what systems of linear equations are and why they are useful. Then present graphical solution as a simple method for solving systems of linear equations. Give the students an opportunity to try solving some simple equation systems graphically and give positive feedback for their efforts.
> 
> Lesson 2: Algebraic solution for systems of linear equations. Focus on teaching the students how to solve systems of linear equations using algebraic methods, such as substitution and elimination. Use examples from real-life situations to make it more relatable and engaging for the students. Give the students an opportunity to try solving equation systems using algebraic methods and give positive feedback for their efforts.
> 
> Lesson 3: Summary and practice. Go over important concepts and methods presented during the previous lessons. Give the students an opportunity to practice solving systems of linear equations using both graphical and algebraic methods. Give positive feedback for the students' efforts and give the opportunity for the students to ask questions and get help with any difficulties.
> 
> **Thank you! Can you suggest real-life situations where systems of linear equations are useful, especially relevant to students taking the social sciences program?**
> 
> Yes, there are many real-life situations where systems of linear equations are useful and particularly relevant to students in social science programs. Here are a few examples:
> 
> 1. Economics: Economists often use systems of linear equations to model related variables, such as related prices or income and expenses.
> 2. Demography: Demographers often use systems of linear equations to describe population growth and changes over time.
> 3. Sociology: Sociologists often use systems of linear equations to describe relationships between different social phenomena, such as the relationship between education and income.
> 4. Marketing: Marketers often use systems of linear equations to describe relationships between different marketing variables, such as the relationship between advertising costs and sales.
> 5. Geography: Geographers often use systems of linear equations to describe relationships between different geographical variables, such as the relationship between distance and time.
> 
> These are just a few examples of how systems of linear equations are used in different social science fields, but there are many more. It's good to use real-life examples from different areas to make teaching more relatable and engaging for students.

## Feedback on Lesson Plans
ChatGPT can provide feedback that is sometimes accurate and often at least helps to spark new thoughts and perspectives on lesson plans and other preparations.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* Do the suggestions from ChatGPT seem useful and well thought-out for teaching purposes?
* What are the pros and cons of asking ChatGPT for feedback on a lesson plan compared to asking a colleague?
* Asking ChatGPT for feedback on lesson plans requires that the plans are written down. How can you record lesson plans in a way that does not take too much time?

> **Below is a summary of a lesson introducing systems of linear equations to a first-year science class in upper secondary school.**
> 
> **Lecture by me, on the board:**
> * **Brief review of the equation for a straight line and how solutions can be drawn in a coordinate system.**
> * **A real-life situation containing two relationships, each of which can be described with a linear equation.**
> * **Representation of the situation as both two linear equations and two lines in a coordinate system.**
> * **Arguments for both equations being satisfied at the point where the lines intersect.**
> 
> **Summary and reflection:**
> * **Three randomly selected students get to say something about what they learned, or pose any questions they have.**
> 
> **Practice using methods and concepts:**
> * **Presentation of another real-life situation with two relationships that can be described with two linear equations.**
> * **Students work individually and then in pairs to solve the problem, by drawing lines and identifying the intersection point.**
> * **Collective reflection on results and methods.**
> 
> **More practice:**
> * **Work on selected exercises in the math book, on the same topic.**
> 
> **Can you suggest ways to improve the lesson plan to make it more engaging for students?**
> 
> It seems like you have planned a structured and comprehensive lesson on systems of linear equations, and there are several things you can do to engage students more in the lesson:
> 1. Use more real-life examples and problems: Using examples and problems that students can relate to and see relevance in can help keep their interest awake.
> 2. Give students opportunities to work on their own: By giving students opportunities to work on their own or in pairs, you can increase their personal involvement in the lesson, which can help increase their engagement.
> 3. Use different methods to explain concepts and ideas: It may be beneficial to use different methods to explain concepts and ideas, such as demonstrations, examples, analogies, and visual aids. This can help students get a deeper understanding and remember concepts longer.
> 4. Give students opportunities to ask questions and participate in discussions: By giving students opportunities to ask questions and participate in discussions, you can increase their understanding and engagement in the lesson.
> 5. Use different types of exercises and tasks: Using different types of exercises and tasks, such as problem-solving tasks, group exercises, and individual exercises, can help students explore different aspects of the concept in a more hands-on way.
> 
> **Can you suggest three short questions to use as exit tickets?**
> 
> Exit tickets are a good tool for quickly getting an idea of students' understanding and can be used to identify any areas that may need extra support. Here are three suggestions for short questions that you can use as exit tickets after the lesson on systems of linear equations:
> 
> 1. Briefly describe what a system of linear equations is and what it is used for.
> 2. How do you draw two straight lines in a coordinate system and how do you find their point of intersection?
> 3. Give an example of a real-life problem that can be solved by using a system of linear equations.

## Suggestions for Describing or Explaining Topics

As ChatGPT's messages sometimes contain inaccuracies (or often for certain topics), it is inappropriate to directly let ChatGPT explain things to students. However, ChatGPT can provide good suggestions that you as a teacher can assess and then either use yourself or pass on to the student (after any adjustments). It also provides the opportunity to take into account special circumstances for groups or individual students.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* Do the answers from ChatGPT seem to be factually correct? Are there things you would like to add or change?
* What do you think, from a pedagogical perspective, about creating descriptions tailored to specific interests that students have?
* Feel free to ask ChatGPT to describe one or more concepts that you yourself teach students. Can you spot any factual errors or skewed perspectives? Also feel free to try asking ChatGPT to explain something based on specific interests of one or more of your students.

> **Can you explain the mechanisms of inflation on a level suitable for a 15 year old student?**
> 
> Inflation is a rise in prices of goods and services over time. It means that the same amount of money can buy you fewer goods and services.
> 
> Think of it like a balloon. As you blow air into the balloon, it gets bigger and takes up more space. In the same way, as more money is added to an economy, the value of each unit of money (like a dollar) decreases and prices for goods and services go up.
> 
> The main drivers of inflation are:
> 
> 1. Increase in demand for goods and services: When people have more money to spend, they buy more, which can cause prices to go up.
> 2. Increase in production costs: When it costs more for businesses to produce goods and services, they may raise their prices to make up for the extra cost.
> 3. Decrease in the supply of money: When there is less money in circulation, each unit of money is worth more and can buy more goods and services, leading to lower inflation.
> 
> Overall, inflation is a normal part of a healthy economy, but too much inflation can cause problems. The central bank (like the Federal Reserve in the U.S.) tries to control inflation by adjusting the supply of money in the economy.
> 
> **I have a student who is really into basketball. Can you explain inflation in a way that is engaging for someone who likes basketball?**
> 
> Sure! Let's use basketball to explain inflation.
> 
> Imagine you're playing a game of one-on-one basketball and you have a dollar. This dollar can buy you one drink from the concession stand before the game. However, as the game goes on and more people show up to watch, the demand for drinks increases. The concession stand raises their prices to make up for the extra demand. Now, your dollar can only buy you half of a drink.
> 
> This is similar to what happens in the economy with inflation. As the demand for goods and services goes up, prices go up too, which means your money can buy you less.
> 
> Just like in basketball, there are different factors that can cause inflation. For example, if the cost of ingredients for the drinks at the concession stand goes up, the concession stand may have to raise their prices. This is like when a key player on your team gets injured and you have to find a replacement. This can lead to increased costs for the team, which could lead to higher ticket prices for fans.
> 
> The central bank (like the Federal Reserve in the U.S.) works like a coach in this situation. Just like a coach would make adjustments to the team during the game, the central bank adjusts the supply of money in the economy to help control inflation and keep prices stable.

> **Below are the graduation requirements for the natural science program, which the student is taking. It includes the requirements for the upper-secondary theses.**
>  
> **[Document describing the upper secondary natural science program in Sweden.]**
>  
> A suggestion for a question for a high school thesis in genetics that would fit into the natural science program could be: "How are gene expressions affected by different environmental factors? A comparison between indoor and outdoor environments of a certain organism."
>  
> Another suggestion could be: "Genetic causes of diseases – a study of a certain disease and its genetic factors."
>  
> A third suggestion could be: "CRISPR-Cas9 – a revolutionary technology for gene editing and its possibilities and challenges"
>  
> These suggestions would provide an opportunity for students to develop their knowledge in genetics, as well as to use their skills in critical thinking, logical reasoning, problem-solving, and systematic observations. Additionally, it would give students the opportunity to develop the ability to evaluate different types of sources and to differentiate between claims that are based on scientific and non-scientific foundations.

## Create Randomized Groups

ChatGPT can create (somewhat) randomized groups fulfilling specific requirements.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* If you were to make group assignments with requirements similar to those in the example, would you need to review the groups to ensure they are correct? How much time would you save?

> **Can you divide these 24 students into groups of 3–4 per group? I want Alice and Bob to be in different groups, and Isak and Jakob to be in the same group. Also, Lena + Viktor, Zara + Felix, and Emma + Malte should be in the same group.**
>  
> **[List of 24 made-up names.]**
>  
> Here's a proposal for dividing the students into groups:
>  
> * Group 1: Alice, Elin, Johan, Liam
> * Group 2: Bob, Julia, Klara, Nora
> * Group 3: Isak, Jakob, Lena, Viktor
> * Group 4: Felix, Zara, Emma, Malte
> * Group 5: Hanna, Linn, Maja, Oskar
> * Group 6: Sara, Sofia, Tilda, Wilma
