# 6: Inspiration for Planning
One of ChatGPT's strongest branches is to provide ideas and inspiration. You can ask for ten ideas and choose the ones that feel worth pursuing, or ask for ten more with a slightly different question if none of the answers fit well. This can be a useful tool when planning lessons, courses or areas of study.

## Inspiration for Planning Setups
When asking ChatGPT for planning suggestions, it is particularly important to be aware of pedagogical pitfalls: ChatGPT does not take the Swedish school's governance documents as a starting point and does not know the conditions in your class or group - unless you tell it. The answers from ChatGPT can provide inspiration, even if they are not exactly right.

**When reading the conversations, consider:**
* Would you like support with planning drafts? Why, or why not?
* Do the suggestions from ChatGPT seem useful and pedagogically well thought out?
* What assumptions does ChatGPT make about the forms of teaching? Does it match how you usually teach? If not, are there things you can and want to adopt?
* Feel free to try asking for planning drafts for larger or smaller parts of your teaching yourself. You will probably get better answers if you provide detailed descriptions of the conditions or what type of planning you want.

> **I'm going to teach about linear equation systems for students in the social sciences program. I have a total of three lessons for the area, with 60 minutes per lesson. Afterwards, I want them to be able to use linear equation systems to describe realistic situations and have a reasonable confidence in solving linear equation systems (preferably with more than one method). A noticeable part of the class is uncertain when it comes to algebra and counting, and several students think that math is boring. It is therefore important that the students feel that they are learning things and succeeding, and I want the teaching to be engaging. Do you have suggestions for the setup of the three lessons?**
>
> For the students to feel that they are learning things and succeeding, and for the teaching to be engaging, the following setup for the three lessons may be appropriate:
>
> Lesson 1: Introduction to linear equation systems and graphical solution. Start by giving the students an overall understanding of what linear equation systems are and why they are useful. Then present graphical solution as a simple method for solving linear equation systems. Give the students an opportunity to try solving some simple equation systems graphically and give positive feedback for their efforts.
>
> Lesson 2: Algebraic solution of linear equation systems. Focus on teaching the students how to solve linear equation systems using algebraic methods, such as substitution and elimination. Use examples from real-life situations to make it more relatable and engaging for the students. Give the students an opportunity to try solving equation systems using algebraic methods and give positive feedback for their efforts.
>
> Lesson 3: Summary and practice. Go over important concepts and methods presented during the previous lessons. Give the students an opportunity to practice solving linear equation systems using both graphical and algebraic methods. Give positive feedback for the students' efforts and give the opportunity for the students to ask questions and get help with any difficulties.
>
> **Thank you! Can you suggest real-life situations where linear equations systems are useful, especially relevant to students in social sciences programs?**
>
> Yes, there are many real-life situations where linear equation systems are useful and particularly relevant to students in social science programs. Here are a few examples:
>
> 1. Economics: Economists often use linear equation systems to model related variables, such as related prices or income and expenses.
> 2. Demography: Demographers often use linear equation systems to describe population growth and changes over time.
> 3. Sociology: Sociologists often use linear equation systems to describe relationships between different social phenomena, such as the relationship between education and income.
> 4. Marketing: Marketers often use linear equation systems to describe relationships between different marketing variables, such as the relationship between advertising costs and sales.
> 5. Geography: Geographers often use linear equation systems to describe relationships between different geographical variables, such as the relationship between distance and time.
>
> These are just a few examples of how linear equation systems are used in different social science fields, but there are many more. It's good to use real-life examples from different areas to make teaching more relatable and engaging for students.

## Feedback on Lesson Plans
ChatGPT can provide feedback that is sometimes accurate and often at least helps to spark new thoughts and perspectives on lesson plans and preparations.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* Do the suggestions from ChatGPT seem useful and well thought-out for teaching purposes?
* What are the pros and cons of asking ChatGPT for feedback on a lesson plan compared to asking a colleague?
* Asking ChatGPT for feedback on lesson plans requires that they are written down. How can you record lesson plans in a way that does not take too much time but still provides meaningful descriptions?

> 2. How do you draw two straight lines in a coordinate system and how do you find their point of intersection?
> 3. Give an example of a real-life problem that can be solved by using a linear equation system.

## Suggestions for Describing or Explaining Topics

As ChatGPT's messages sometimes contain inaccuracies (or often for certain areas), it is inappropriate to directly let ChatGPT explain things to students. However, ChatGPT can provide good suggestions that you as a teacher can assess and then either use yourself or pass on to the student (after any adjustments). It also provides the opportunity to take into account special circumstances for groups or individual students.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* Do the answers from ChatGPT seem to match the facts? Are there things you would like to add or change?
* What do you think from a pedagogical perspective about creating descriptions tailored to specific interests that students have?
* Feel free to ask ChatGPT to describe one or more concepts that are in your teaching and consider factual errors and biases or perspectives. Also feel free to try asking ChatGPT to explain based on specific interests of one or more of your students.

> **Can you explain the mechanisms of inflation on a level suitable for a 15 year old student?**
>
> Inflation is a rise in prices of goods and services over time. It means that the same amount of money can buy you fewer goods and services.
>
> Think of it like a balloon. As you blow air into the balloon, it gets bigger and takes up more space. In the same way, as more money is added to an economy, the value of each unit of money (like a dollar) decreases and prices for goods and services go up.
>
> The main drivers of inflation are:
>
> 1. Increase in demand for goods and services: When people have more money to spend, they buy more, which can cause prices to go up.
> 2. Increase in production costs: When it costs more for businesses to produce goods and services, they may raise their prices to make up for the extra cost.
> 3. Decrease in the supply of money: When there is less money in circulation, each unit of money is worth more and can buy more goods and services, leading to lower inflation.
>
> Overall, inflation is a normal part of a healthy economy, but too much inflation can cause problems. The central bank (like the Federal Reserve in the U.S.) tries to control inflation by adjusting the supply of money in the economy.
>
> **I have a student who is really into basketball. Can you explain inflation in a way that is engaging for someone who likes baskeball?**
>
> Sure! Let's use basketball to explain inflation.
>
> Imagine you're playing a game of one-on-one basketball and you have a dollar. This dollar can buy you one drink from the concession stand before the game. However, as the game goes on and more people show up to watch, the demand for drinks increases. The concession stand raises their prices to make up for the extra demand. Now, your dollar can only buy you half of a drink.
>
> This is similar to what happens in the economy with inflation. As the demand for goods and services goes up, prices go up too, which means your money can buy you less.
>
> Just like in basketball, there are different factors that can cause inflation. For example, if the cost of ingredients for the drinks at the concession stand goes up, the concession stand may have to raise their prices. This is like when a key player on your team gets injured and you have to find a replacement. This can lead to increased costs for the team, which could lead to higher ticket prices for fans.
>
> The central bank (like the Federal Reserve in the U.S.) works like a coach in this situation. Just like a coach would make adjustments to the team during the game, the central bank adjusts the supply of money in the economy to help control inflation and keep prices stable.
