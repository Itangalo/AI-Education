# 10: Miscellaneous
In this chapter, there are some more specific or unusual examples of what ChatGPT can be used for in a teacher's work.

## Friendly and well-written comments
When grading papers or other texts, it can be helpful to not have to think about phrasing things kindly and neatly, in order to work faster. It's possible to let ChatGPT handle the phrasing.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* Does it save time to let ChatGPT create phrasings?
* Is there a way to make it faster to use ChatGPT for getting well-written short comments?

> **I need help grading student papers. I will write a few short words, such as "repetition" or "spelling error". Your job is to give me short, well-phrased and clear sentences that I can paste as comments to the students. For example, "There's a repetition here. Can you choose a different word?" or "The spelling is incorrect here. Please check and fix it."**
>  
> **Are you ready?**
>  
> Yes, I am ready to help you provide short, well-phrased, and clear comments to the students when grading their papers. Please send over the words you want me to help with.

> 
> **Better transition**
> 
> "Try using a better transition between paragraphs to make the text more fluid."
> 
> **Fact check?**
> 
> "It seems like there's a factual mistake in this paragraph, please check and correct it."

## Tips for Study Techniques for Specific Tasks
ChatGPT can give suggestions for specific tasks to practice, to improve in something that one or a group of students are working on. It can be practical to help students improve what they specifically need.

**When reading the conversations, consider:**
* Do you think the lists would be useful for the students? What would you like to change or add?
* Would the language work for providing directly to the students?
* What are the educational benefits of giving individual or smaller groups of students instructions for things to work on? What are the time savings with getting drafts from ChatGPT?

> ** Can you write a list of specific and concrete steps that a student can follow to improve their ability to write laboratory reports?**
>  
> Yes, I can give you a list of steps that a student can follow to improve their ability to write laboratory reports:
>

> 3. Take comprehensive notes during the experiment, including measurement values, observations, and conclusions.
> 4. Use correct scientific terminology and formatting in your report.
> 5. Carefully read through your report after you have finished writing and make sure it is easy to understand and follows the instructions.
> 6. Get feedback from the teacher or a classmate before submitting your report to learn about any improvements.

Ideas and suggestions that ChatGPT can come up with are of course not limited to education.

**As you read the conversation, consider:**
* Are the answers from ChatGPT useful?
* Is there anything inappropriate in the answers?
* Feel free to ask ChatGPT for suggestions for any type of activity outside of teaching. Also, try asking follow-up questions to create material or planning for an activity.

> Here are some suggestions for activities that could be fun to do with a mentor class in the natural science program:
> 1. "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" - create a challenging quiz with scientific content and let the students compete against each other in groups or individually.
> 2. "Puzzle Crosswords" - create a crossword with scientific terms and concepts that the students can try to solve together.
> 3. "The Labyrinth" - create a labyrinth with scientific content and let the students try to navigate through it together in groups.

> Regardless of which activity you choose, make sure to give the students an opportunity to collaborate and have fun together. Good luck with the Christmas ending!

## Bring life to your lesson with poetry based on today's teaching

**When reading the conversations, consider:**
* What educational points are there with humor like this?
* Feel free to try creating other unexpected pieces of art based on something you will be teaching in the next few days.

> **Can you write a poem about the Citric acid cycle in Sylvia Plath style?**

> Sure, here's a poem about the citric acid cycle in the style of Sylvia Plath:

> A cycle of life, a cycle of death,
> A whirlpool of energy with every breath.
> 
> In the dark chambers of the cells within,
> The citric acid churns, a fiery spin.
> A symphony of enzymes, a cacophony of pain,
> A burning in the muscles, a constant strain.
> 
> With every turn, a molecule is born,
> A spark of energy to light the dawn.
> A push and a pull, a rise and a fall,
> A never-ending cycle, a carnival.
> 
> And yet, amidst the chaos and the heat,
> There's a beauty in this cycle, a secret treat.
> For without the citric acid, without its pain,
> Life would not exist, nor would remain.
> 
> So let the citric acid swirl and spin,
> Let it consume and conquer from within.
> For it is the spark that keeps us alive,
> The fiery cycle of the citric acid drive.
