# AI in Education:  
A Teacher’s Guide to ChatGPT
ChatGPT was launched at the end of 2022 and has spread like wildfire. It's a web-based service where you can chat with an artificial intelligence (AI) that's knowledgeable in a surprising number of areas, is friendly and articulated, adapts to your demands, and never gets tired of helping and answering questions. People are using ChatGPT for a variety of tasks, including cooking, programming, writing articles, and creating interactive games. ChatGPT and future services like it will likely impact society and daily life in many and different ways.

This book is about how you, as a teacher, can use ChatGPT to make your job easier. The book also covers how _not_ to use ChatGPT in your teaching. A central theme of the book is judgement, which is particularly relevant with powerful tools that have not been systematically tested in education.

Part 1 of the book provides an introduction to what ChatGPT is and how to get started using the service. The end of Chapter 3 contains some tips that may also be useful for someone who has been using ChatGPT for a while. Chapter 2 is crucial, as it describes four potential pitfalls of AI that teachers need to be aware of.

Part 2 focuses on practical applications. Chapters 5–10 contain examples of how you can use ChatGPT to make your job easier, and are probably the ones you will find most useful. While browsing the chapters for inspiration, be sure to read Chapter 4, which covers the dangers of misusing ChatGPT. Chapter 11 covers the issue of ChatGPT and cheating.

Part 3 is primarily for those who want to know a bit more about AI itself. Chapter 12 provides background on recent AI developments, including some information on ChatGPT and the company OpenAI that owns the service. Chapter 13 discusses how our view of knowledge may change due to tools like ChatGPT and Chapter 14 covers risks of AI from a broader perspective. Finally there are some tips for those who want to know more about using AI as a teacher or general questions about AI.

The author of the book, Johan Falk, is a former science journalist, web developer, and teacher. I've been following AI development since 2018 and been interested in school issues since high school. Since 2015, I've been working for education at a national level. The book is written and signed by myself, but several ideas and improvements come from other people. Special thanks to Rustan Håkansson.
