# 7: Create Materials

## Create texts for students to build upon
ChatGPT can be used to give ideas for writing assignments or starting points that students can build upon after the suggestions have been reviewed and possibly adjusted.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* Do the suggestions from ChatGPT seem engaging and useful for 15-year-olds?
* Are there parts of the answers that might be inappropriate for one reason or another?

> **I have a lesson where students will practice writing argumentative texts. Can you create ten short introductions to argumentative texts, a couple of sentences long each, that deal with areas that might engage 15-year-olds?**
>  
> Sure! Here are ten suggestions for introductions to argumentative texts that might engage 15-year-olds:
> 
> 1. "Mobile phones are a necessity in our lives today, but there is also a dark side to the constant connection. Should we limit our use of mobile phones to protect our mental health?"
> 2. "Streaming services like Netflix and Spotify have revolutionized how we consume entertainment. But is it really worth paying for a subscription every month when there is so much free content available on the internet?"
> 3. "E-sports is a rapidly growing industry, but many argue that it should not be considered a sport. Should we accept e-sports as an equal form of sport or continue to regard it as a game?"
> 4. "Social media is an effective way to keep in touch with friends and family, but it can also create stress and comparison anxiety. Should we limit our time on social media to protect our mental health?"
> 5. "Virtual realities are an exciting and innovative area that offers limitless opportunities. But it's also important to avoid becoming too lost in them. Should we be more aware of our time in virtual realities?"
> 6. "Having your own car is a symbol of freedom for many, but it can also lead to increased car dependence and environmental problems. Should we consider using alternative modes of transportation to reduce our environmental impact?"
> 7. "Access to information is easy and convenient with the help of the internet, but there is also a lot of misinformation. Should we be more critical of what we read and share on the internet?"
> 8. "Eating vegetarian and vegan is popular, but there are also many counterarguments. Should we consider changing our diet to reduce our environmental impact and improve our health?"
> 9. "Online shopping is convenient and \[ChatGPT response ended here.\]

## Create fake student examples to discuss
In some cases, it may be sensitive to use examples from individual students, and in such cases, using texts generated by ChatGPT could be an alternative. The excerpt below could for example be used as a basis for discussing how the text can be improved both in form and content.

**When you read the conversation, think about:**
* What are the educational advantages and disadvantages of using fabricated student examples instead of actual ones?
* Does the answer from ChatGPT match what Swedish children would probably write, or does it more correspond to what students in other countries would write? (Note that the question to ChatGPT was originally asked in Swedish.)
* Feel free to ask ChatGPT for other short essays on topics you choose, such as what students of different ages would have written them. Does it work to ask ChatGPT to include common spelling errors?
* What happens if you ask ChatGPT to write as a student with an immigrant background - and what does it mean if you get differences in the answer?

> **Can you write a short essay (about 150 words) about Astrid Lindgren, as a 14-year-old could have written?**
>  
> Astrid Lindgren was a Swedish author who wrote many well-known children's books. She was born in 1907 and died in 2002. She is most famous for the books about Pippi Longstocking, Emil in Lönneberga and Karlsson on the Roof. Astrid Lindgren's books are very popular all over the world and have been translated into many different languages. She also won the Hans Christian Andersen Prize for her books. Astrid Lindgren's books often feature children who are brave and take on challenges. Her books are both fun and important because they deal with being kind to others and that everyone is different but equally important.

## Create examples for students to learn from
The human brain seems to be built to learn from examples, but as a teacher, it can be difficult to put together examples that cover a sufficiently wide range. With the help of ChatGPT, you can quickly create many examples to review, possibly adjust, and use in your teaching. You can also imagine evaluating ChatGPT texts based on grading criteria, to give students a better idea of what different qualities can mean. 

**When you read the conversations, consider:**
* Are the book reviews sufficiently different to serve as examples of different styles? If not, can you get ChatGPT to get more spread in them?
* Are there areas in your own teaching where you would like to have many different text examples to show students? Can you get ChatGPT to create such examples?

> ** My students are practicing writing book reviews, and I would need a number of examples that show what book reviews can look like. I want the examples to reflect different ways of writing reviews, and I will ask you for more and more examples. All examples should be based on the first book in the Harry Potter series. Can you give me a first example of a book review about 150 words?**
>  
> "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantastic debut book by J.K. Rowling. The story of the young Harry Potter, an orphan boy who discovers he is a wizard, is both gripping and charming. The book contains a number of different characters, many of whom are as memorable as they are versatile, including the ruthless former wizard Lord Voldemort and the wise and loyal Hermione Granger.
>  
> It is difficult to tear yourself away from Harry Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, where he learns about magic and witchcraft while fighting to solve the mystery of the philosopher's stone. The book is well written and easy to read, and it is hard not to fall in love with the story and characters.
>  
> I strongly recommend Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to anyone who loves fantasy and adventure, and I look forward to reading the rest of the series."
>
> **Thank you! Can you create another review, in a new style, about 200 words?**
>  
> "J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a powerful opening to a series that would change the fantasy genre forever. The plot is exciting, with a young protagonist discovering his wizard identity and being drawn into a world filled with magic and dangers.
>  
> The characters are vivid and well-developed, with Harry as a sympathetic hero constantly fighting against injustice and evil. I also loved Rowling's depiction of the school Hogwarts, which felt like a place with real life and personality.
>  
> But what really makes Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone an unforgettable reading experience is Rowling's ability to create a world that feels so real and filled with details. She has created a world that you really want to visit and experience.
>  
> I cannot recommend Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone enough. It's a unique and gripping story that's suitable for all ages. A must-read for all fantasy fans."
>  
> **Thank you! Can you create another one, in a new style, in just 70 words? I want this one to be more critical of the book.**
>  
> "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J.K. Rowling is an okay debut book. The plot is quite simple and the characters are not particularly deep. The writing style is well-written but there's not enough plot or complexity to keep the reader engaged. An okay fantasy debut, but nothing more than that."

## Create statements for students to evaluate and discuss
After working with a topic, it may be interesting to show the class what ChatGPT has to say about the topic, and allow the students to discuss or evaluate what ChatGPT says. Are the important things included? Is something wrong? Is there something included that we wouldn't have chosen to bring up? One can also ask ChatGPT to create intentionally simplistic texts.

**When reading the conversations, consider:**
* Are there areas in your teaching where it is pedagogically meaningful for students to discuss and evaluate statements? Would it be meaningful for students to compare different texts written by ChatGPT? Would it be better if the texts were written by you as a teacher, or perhaps by students?

> **Can you describe the water cycle, as a 9-year-old would describe it, with a few spelling mistakes and using uppercase letters?**
> 
> The water on Earth moves in a cycle called the WATER CYCLE. It starts with the sun HEATING UP the water in the oceans and lakes. When the water gets warm, it starts to steam up and become clouds. Then it can become rain or snow that falls back down to the ground. When it rains or snows, the water ends up in rivers and lakes again or it can land on the ground and become groundwater. Then the water in rivers and lakes can flow back to the ocean again and the whole process starts over.

> **Can you summarize what operant conditioning is at a level suitable for high school?**
>  
> Operant conditioning is a form of learning that focuses on understanding how different actions affect consequences. It involves understanding that our actions have an impact on what happens around us and that we can use this knowledge to influence our behavior.
>  
> Simply put, it is about learning to do things that give us rewards and avoiding things that result in punishment or discomfort. This learning occurs through positive or negative feedback after we have performed a certain action.
>  
> Operant conditioning is an important theory in behavior psychology and has been used to explain how humans and animals learn new behaviors and change their existing behaviors. The theory has also been used to develop various methods for influencing and shaping behaviors, such as using rewards and punishments to change behavior.


## Creating Study Questions or Other Questions for Texts
ChatGPT can be used to create study questions for texts at various levels.

**When you read the conversations, consider:**
* If you give students questions for texts, is it to check if they have read the text or to help them focus on the content of the text? What role does the ChatGPT's suggestions seem to play?
* Feel free to ask ChatGPT to create study questions for a text that relates to your teaching. (An easily accessible example is text from a relevant article on Wikipedia.) Do the study questions seem pedagogically meaningful?

> **I'm giving my pupils in first grade as homework to read the story "Little Red Riding Hood", pasted in full below. Can you give me suggestions for five questions they should write answers to, to make sure that they have understood the text?**
> 
> **\[The full story.\]**
>
> 1. Who gave Little Red Riding Hood the red velvet cap?
> 2. Where did Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother live?
> 3. Who did Little Red Riding Hood meet in the woods?
> 4. What did Little Red Riding Hood bring to her grandmother?
> 5. What did the wolf do when he reached Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother's house?

## Seven Study Questions on Organic Acids
> **\[Text from [Wikipedia's article on organic acids][1]\]**
>
> 1. What is an organic acid?
> 2. What type of acids are the most common organic acids?
> 3. How can one determine the acidity level of an organic acid?
> 4. Can alcohols act as acids and if so, how strong are they typically?
> 5. What are some common examples of organic acids?
> 6. Why are organic acids typically weaker than mineral acids?
> 7. What type of use do organic acids have in food preservation and what effect do they have on bacteria?


## Create Glossaries
Using ChatGPT can be an effective way to create glossaries for concepts in a work area if such are not already available.

**When reading the conversation, think about:**
* Does the information from ChatGPT seem correct?
* Does the text need to be adjusted before it can be given to students?

> **Can you make a glossary with short explanations for these terms? It's for my high school biology class.**
> 
> **DNA, RNA, cell wall, cell nucleus, lysosome, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus**
> 
> DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) - is the genetic material found in all living organisms and carries information on how the organism should develop and function.
> 
> RNA (ribonucleic acid) - is a nucleic acid that is important for protein synthesis and is involved in the transfer of genetic information from DNA to ribosomes.
> 
> Cell wall - is an outer layer that surrounds many bacteria and plant cells, providing support and protection to the cell.
> 
> Cell nucleus - is a central part of a cell where the cell's genetic material, DNA, is located. It is also the place where the cell's genetic material is regulated and controlled.
> 
> Lysosome - is a small organelle within a cell that is responsible for breaking down and removing waste and contaminated materials.
> 
> Mitochondria - are organelles within the cell that are responsible for producing energy for the cell through the process known as cellular respiration.
> 
> Golgi apparatus - is an organelle within the cell that is responsible for managing, sorting, and distributing proteins and other molecules within the cell.
