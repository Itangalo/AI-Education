# 7: Create Materials

## Create texts for students to build upon
ChatGPT can be used to give ideas for writing assignments or starting points that students can build upon after the suggestions have been reviewed and possibly adjusted.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* Do the suggestions from ChatGPT seem engaging and useful for 15-year-olds?
* Are there parts of the answers that might be inappropriate for one reason or another?

> **I have a lesson where students will practice writing argumentative texts. Can you create ten short introductions to argumentative texts, a couple of sentences long each, that deal with areas that might engage 15-year-olds?**
>  
> Sure! Here are ten suggestions for introductions to argumentative texts that might engage 15-year-olds:
> 
> 1. "Mobile phones are a necessity in our lives today, but there is also a dark side to the constant connection. Should we limit our use of mobile phones to protect our mental health?"
> 2. "Streaming services like Netflix and Spotify have revolutionized how we consume entertainment. But is it really worth paying for a subscription every month when there is so much free content available on the internet?"
> 3. "E-sports is a rapidly growing industry, but many argue that it should not be considered a sport. Should we accept e-sports as an equal form of sport or continue to regard it as a game?"
> 4. "Social media is an effective way to keep in touch with friends and family, but it can also create stress and comparison anxiety. Should we limit our time on social media to protect our mental health?"
> 5. "Virtual realities are an exciting and innovative area that offers limitless opportunities. But it's also important to avoid becoming too lost in them. Should we be more aware of our time in virtual realities?"
> 6. "Having your own car is a symbol of freedom for many, but it can also lead to increased car dependence and environmental problems. Should we consider using alternative modes of transportation to reduce our environmental impact?"
> 7. "Access to information is easy and convenient with the help of the internet, but there is also a lot of misinformation. Should we be more critical of what we read and share on the internet?"
> 8. ”Vegetarianism and veganism are popular, but there are also many counterarguments. Should we consider changing our diet to reduce our environmental impact and improve our health?"
> 9. "Online shopping is convenient and [ChatGPT response ended here.]

## Create fake student examples to discuss
In some cases it may be sensitive to use authentic student examples, and in such cases using texts generated by ChatGPT could be an alternative. The excerpt below could for example be used as a basis for discussing how the text can be improved both in form and content.

**When you read the conversation, consider:**
* What are the educational advantages and disadvantages of using fabricated student examples instead of authentic ones?
* Do you think a 14-year-old would focus on different aspects in the essay topic below, depending on which country he or she lives in? If so, which part of the world does the answer from ChatGPT represent?
* Feel free to ask ChatGPT for other short essays on topics you choose, such as what students of different ages would have written them. Does it work to ask ChatGPT to include common spelling errors?
* What happens if you ask ChatGPT to write as a student with an immigration background – and what does it mean if you get differences in the answer?

> **Can you write a short essay (about 150 words) about C. S. Lewis, as a 14-year-old would have written it?**
>  
> C.S. Lewis was a famous author who wrote many amazing books. He was born in Ireland in 1898 and grew up to be one of the most well-known writers of his time. One of his most famous books is "The Chronicles of Narnia," which is a series of seven books about talking animals and magical adventures.
> 
> Lewis was also a Christian writer and wrote many books about faith, including "Mere Christianity" and "The Screwtape Letters." He was a professor at Oxford University and was friends with J.R.R. Tolkien, another famous author.
> 
> Lewis died in 1963, but his books are still loved by people all over the world. If you haven't read any of his books yet, I highly recommend that you do! You'll be transported to amazing places and learn a lot about faith, friendship, and courage.

## Create examples for students to learn from
The human brain seems to be built to learn from examples, but as a teacher it can be difficult to create examples that cover a sufficiently wide range. With the help of ChatGPT, you can quickly create many examples to review, possibly adjust, and use in your teaching. You could also consider evaluating ChatGPT texts based on grading criteria, to give students a better idea of what different grades can represent.

**When you read the conversations, consider:**
* Are the book reviews sufficiently different to serve as examples of different styles? If not, can you get ChatGPT to create a more wide range of texts?
* Are there areas in your own teaching where you would like to have many different text examples to show students? Can you get ChatGPT to create such examples?

> **My students are practicing writing book reviews, and I would need a number of examples that show what book reviews can look like. I want the examples to reflect different ways of writing reviews, and I will ask you for more and more examples. All examples should be based on the first book in the Harry Potter series. Can you give me a first example of a book review about 150 words?**
>  
> "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantastic debut book by J.K. Rowling. The story of the young Harry Potter, an orphan boy who discovers he is a wizard, is both gripping and charming. The book contains a number of different characters, many of whom are as memorable as they are versatile, including the ruthless former wizard Lord Voldemort and the wise and loyal Hermione Granger.
>  
> It is difficult to tear yourself away from Harry Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, where he learns about magic and witchcraft while fighting to solve the mystery of the philosopher's stone. The book is well written and easy to read, and it is hard not to fall in love with the story and characters.
>  
> I strongly recommend Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone to anyone who loves fantasy and adventure, and I look forward to reading the rest of the series."
> 
> **Thank you! Can you create another review, in a new style, about 200 words?**
>  
> "J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a powerful opening to a series that would change the fantasy genre forever. The plot is exciting, with a young protagonist discovering his wizard identity and being drawn into a world filled with magic and dangers.
>  
> The characters are vivid and well-developed, with Harry as a sympathetic hero constantly fighting against injustice and evil. I also loved Rowling's depiction of the school Hogwarts, which felt like a place with real life and personality.
>  
> But what really makes Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone an unforgettable reading experience is Rowling's ability to create a world that feels so real and filled with details. She has created a world that you really want to visit and experience.
>  
> I cannot recommend Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone enough. It's a unique and gripping story that's suitable for all ages. A must-read for all fantasy fans."
>  
> **Thank you! Can you create another one, in a new style, in just 70 words? I want this one to be more critical of the book.**
>  
> "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J.K. Rowling is an okay debut book. The plot is quite simple and the characters are not particularly deep. The writing style is well-written but there's not enough plot or complexity to keep the reader engaged. An okay fantasy debut, but nothing more than that."

## Create statements for students to evaluate and discuss
After working on a topic, it may be interesting to show the class what ChatGPT has to say about the topic, and allow the students to discuss or evaluate the statements. Are the important things included? Is something wrong? Is there something included that we wouldn't have mentioned? You can also ask ChatGPT to create intentionally simplistic or even incorrect texts.

**When reading the conversations, consider:**
* Are there areas in your teaching where it is pedagogically meaningful for students to discuss and evaluate statements? Would it be meaningful for students to compare different texts written by ChatGPT? Would it be better if the texts were written by you as a teacher, or perhaps by students?

> **Can you describe the water cycle, as a 9-year-old would describe it, with a few spelling mistakes and using uppercase letters?**
> 
> The water on Earth moves in a cycle called the WATER CYCLE. It starts with the sun HEATING UP the water in the oceans and lakes. When the water gets warm, it starts to steam up and become clouds. Then it can become rain or snow that falls back down to the ground. When it rains or snows, the water ends up in rivers and lakes again or it can land on the ground and become groundwater. Then the water in rivers and lakes can flow back to the ocean again and the whole process starts over.

---- 

> **Can you summarize what operant conditioning is, at a level suitable for high school?**
>  
> Operant conditioning is a type of learning in which behavior is modified by its consequences, either reinforced or punished. Reinforcement strengthens a behavior by providing a reward or positive outcome, while punishment weakens a behavior by providing a negative outcome or consequence. This process helps to shape behavior in desired ways and can be used to understand and influence a wide range of behaviors, from simple habits to complex personality traits.


## Creating Study Questions or Other Questions for Texts
ChatGPT can be used to create study questions for texts at various levels.

**When you read the conversations, consider:**
* If you give students questions for texts, is it to check if they have read the text or to help them focus on the essential content of the text? What role does the ChatGPT's suggestions seem to play?
* Feel free to ask ChatGPT to create study questions for a text that relates to your teaching. (An easily accessible example is text from a relevant article on Wikipedia.) Do the study questions seem pedagogically meaningful?

> **I'm giving my pupils in first grade as homework to read the story "Little Red Riding Hood", pasted in full below. Can you give me suggestions for five questions they should write answers to, to make sure that they have understood the text?**
> 
> **[The full story.]**
> 
> 1. Who gave Little Red Riding Hood the red velvet cap?
> 2. Where did Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother live?
> 3. Who did Little Red Riding Hood meet in the woods?
> 4. What did Little Red Riding Hood bring to her grandmother?
> 5. What did the wolf do when he reached Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother's house?

---- 

> **Can you give me seven study questions to the text below, on organic acids? The questions are for my upper secondary class in chemistry.**
> **[Text from [Wikipedia's article on organic acids][1]]**
> 
> 1. What is an organic acid?
> 2. What type of acids are the most common organic acids?
> 3. How can one determine the acidity level of an organic acid?
> 4. Can alcohols act as acids and if so, how strong are they typically?
> 5. What are some common examples of organic acids?
> 6. Why are organic acids typically weaker than mineral acids?
> 7. What type of use do organic acids have in food preservation and what effect do they have on bacteria?

## Create Glossaries
Using ChatGPT can be an effective way to create glossaries for concepts in a work area, when glossaries are not already available.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* Does the information from ChatGPT seem correct?
* Does the text need to be adjusted before it can be given to students?

> **Can you make a glossary with short explanations for these terms? It's for my high school biology class.**
> 
> **DNA, RNA, cell wall, cell nucleus, lysosome, mitochondria, Golgi apparatus**
> 
> DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) - is the genetic material found in all living organisms and carries information on how the organism should develop and function.
> 
> RNA (ribonucleic acid) - is a nucleic acid that is important for protein synthesis and is involved in the transfer of genetic information from DNA to ribosomes.
> 
> Cell wall - is an outer layer that surrounds many bacteria and plant cells, providing support and protection to the cell.
> 
> Cell nucleus - is a central part of a cell where the cell's genetic material, DNA, is located. It is also the place where the cell's genetic material is regulated and controlled.
> 
> Lysosome - is a small organelle within a cell that is responsible for breaking down and removing waste and contaminated materials.
> 
> Mitochondria - are organelles within the cell that are responsible for producing energy for the cell through the process known as cellular respiration.
> 
> Golgi apparatus - is an organelle within the cell that is responsible for managing, sorting, and distributing proteins and other molecules within the cell.

## Creating Quizzes
ChatGPT can quickly create quiz drafts. Like other AI material, they need to be reviewed before they are used.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* When can a quiz be useful in your teaching?
* If ChatGPT suggests a quiz question about something you haven't covered in your lesson, would you remove it? Why?
* Feel free to ask ChatGPT for a quiz on a topic you recently taught.

> **Can you create 5 quiz questions on the industrial revolution suitable for 17-year-olds? Include three incorrect and one correct answer for each question, and mark the correct answer with an arrow: \<--**
> 
> Sure! Here you go:
> 
> What was the main source of energy during the Industrial Revolution?
> A) Wind power
> B) Coal \<--
> C) Solar power
> D) Hydro power
> 
> Where did the Industrial Revolution begin?

> 
> **Thanks! Can you create a CSV from the questions and answers, so I can import them to my quiz tool?**
> 
> Certainly! Here is the CSV format of the questions and answers:
> 
> Question,Answer 1,Answer 2,Answer 3,Answer 4,Correct Answer
> [The questions and answers above, separated by commas.]

## Customize Assignments or Texts for Student Groups
It can be difficult to find material that is tailored to certain student groups. ChatGPT can, to some extent, write existing material in new contexts.

**As you read the conversations, consider:**
* Do you think it's time-saving to use ChatGPT in the examples below, taking into account any time spent processing AI answers?
* If you needed to make similar customizations often, what would you do to make it faster to use ChatGPT?
* Do you have a need for customized assignments or texts? Try to make ChatGPT customize material in a meaningful way.

(The story in first example contains 529 words, shortened from 1442 words.)

> **Below is the story Little Red Riding Hood, which I will give my pupils to read as home assignment. Can you create a version of the story that is 500–700 words and doesn't contain any difficult words? Also, I want you to write the story with upper-case letters only.**
> [Full story pasted.]
> 
> ONCE UPON A TIME, THERE WAS A LITTLE GIRL NAMED LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD. SHE LIVED WITH HER MOTHER AND HER GRANDMOTHER WHO LOVED HER VERY MUCH. ONE DAY, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD'S MOTHER GAVE HER A LITTLE CAP OF RED VELVET TO WEAR. LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD LOVED THIS CAP SO MUCH THAT SHE WORE IT EVERYDAY.
> 
> LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD'S MOTHER TOLD HER TO GO TO HER GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE WITH A PIECE OF CAKE AND A BOTTLE OF WINE. LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD PROMISED TO BE CAREFUL ON HER WAY TO HER GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE.
> 
> AS LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD ENTERED THE WOOD, A WOLF MET HER. LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD DID NOT KNOW THAT THIS WOLF WAS DANGEROUS AND WAS NOT AFRAID OF HIM. THE WOLF ASKED LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD WHERE SHE WAS GOING. LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD TOLD THE WOLF THAT SHE WAS GOING TO HER GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE TO BRING HER CAKE AND WINE. THE WOLF THOUGHT THAT LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD WOULD BE A BETTER MEAL THAN HER GRANDMOTHER, SO HE DECIDED TO TRICK HER.
> 
> THE WOLF TOLD LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD THAT THE FLOWERS IN THE WOOD WERE PRETTY AND THE BIRDS WERE SINGING BEAUTIFULLY. LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD BECAME INTERESTED AND DECIDED TO PICK FLOWERS FOR HER GRANDMOTHER. THE WOLF THEN RAN TO GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE AND KNOCKED ON THE DOOR. WHEN GRANDMOTHER ASKED WHO WAS THERE, THE WOLF SAID IT WAS LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD WITH CAKE AND WINE. GRANDMOTHER TOLD THE WOLF TO LIFT THE LATCH AND THE WOLF WENT STRAIGHT TO THE BED AND ATE GRANDMOTHER.
> 
> MEANWHILE, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD HAD BEEN PICKING FLOWERS AND FORGOT ALL ABOUT TIME. WHEN SHE FINALLY REMEMBERED HER GRANDMOTHER, SHE WENT TO HER HOUSE. WHEN LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD ENTERED THE ROOM, SHE HAD A STRANGE FEELING. SHE CALLED OUT "GOOD MORNING" BUT RECEIVED NO ANSWER. WHEN SHE DREW BACK THE CURTAINS, SHE SAW HER GRANDMOTHER IN BED. HER GRANDMOTHER HAD BIG EARS, BIG EYES, BIG HANDS, AND A BIG MOUTH. THE GRANDMOTHER TOLD LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD THAT SHE HAD BIG EARS TO HEAR BETTER, BIG EYES TO SEE BETTER, BIG HANDS TO HUG BETTER, AND A BIG MOUTH TO EAT BETTER. THEN THE WOLF SWALLOWED LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD.
> 
> THE WOLF THEN WENT TO
> 
> **Please continue.**
> 
> THE HUNTSMAN HEARD THE SNORING AND THOUGHT TO HIMSELF, "WHAT CAN BE MAKING SUCH A NOISE?" HE DECIDED TO INVESTIGATE AND CAME UPON THE GRANNY'S HOUSE. HE NOTICED THE DOOR WAS AJAR AND WALKED IN. HE SAW THE WOLF ASLEEP IN THE BED AND REALIZED THAT HE HAD EATEN LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD. HE DREW OUT HIS KNIFE AND WITH ONE STROKE CUT OPEN THE WOLF'S BELLY. HE SAW LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD AND GRANNY, ALIVE AND UNHURT. HE PULLED THEM OUT AND TOOK THEM HOME TO THEIR MOTHER.
> 
> FROM THAT DAY FORWARD, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD WAS NEVER AGAIN ALLOWED TO WANDER OFF THE PATH WHEN SHE WENT TO VISIT HER GRANNY. SHE LEARNED THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO BE CAREFUL AND TO LISTEN TO THE ADVICE OF HER MOTHER AND OTHERS. AND GRANNY LIVED TO BE A HAPPY OLD LADY FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THAT.

> **Below is a math problem adjusted for third grade. Can you change the context of the problem so that it fits for my adult students, but still contains the same type of math?**
> 
> **On the playground, there are 17 children. After a while, 5 more children arrive. How many children are there on the playground then?**
> **Show your calculation and write the answer.**
> 
> In a company, there are 17 employees. After the recruitment, there will be 5 more employees. How many employees will there be in the company after the recruitment?
> Calculation: 17 + 5 = 22
> Answer: 22 employees.

---- 

> **Can you create an easy-to-read version of the text below? Remove all references in brackets.**
> 
> **[Inlined text from the beginning of [Wikipedia's article on global warming][2], about 460 words.]**
> 
> Climate change is the ongoing increase in global average temperature caused by humans burning fossil fuels. This leads to increased levels of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which trap more heat in the Earth's atmosphere and cause global warming. The effects of climate change include expanding deserts, more frequent heat waves and wildfires, melting permafrost, and intense storms. Climate change also threatens people with food and water scarcity, increased flooding, and more disease. Poorer countries, which have the least ability to adapt, are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. To limit warming to 1.5°C, emissions must be reduced by halving them by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. This requires generating electricity from low-carbon sources and removing carbon from the atmosphere.

## Improving Own Texts
ChatGPT can process large amounts of text and provide (often) meaningful feedback on it. Since feedback should be used judiciously, it is recommended to use AI feedback as a teacher, not as feedback given unreviewed to students.

Feedback is often more useful when asking about specific aspects, such as making it more readable, more engaging, or what parts of the text need improvement.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* What are the advantages and disadvantages of asking for feedback from ChatGPT compared to from colleagues?
* Do the suggestions from ChatGPT seem useful?
* Feel free to test asking for feedback on lesson materials or other texts you have written. Make sure to describe what type of feedback you want, or in what context the text is intended to be used.

> **Below is a text intended for upper secondary students and dealing with quadratic equations – an introduction and then presentation of three different ways to solve quadratic equations. Can you give me suggestions on how to improve the text?**
> **[Embedded text from [Solving Quadratic Equations: A Recipe (in Swedish)][3]]**
> 
> Here are some suggestions on how the text can be improved:
> 1. Add an introduction that gives the reader an overview of what the text is about and why it can be useful.
> 2. Be more specific in your definition of quadratic equations and provide examples of such equations.
> 3. Provide more examples of quadratic equations and how to solve them, so that the reader gets a better understanding of how to solve different types of equations.
> 4. Make the text more readable by using clear and simple terms and explain any more advanced concepts when they appear.
> 5. Add a conclusion or summary of the text so that the reader can have an overview of what has been learned and what will be needed to solve quadratic equations.
> 6. Add links to additional resources for the reader who wants to learn more about the subject.
> 7. Correct any spelling and grammar errors in the text to make it easier to read and understand.

## Create Drafts for Recurring Texts
ChatGPT can save time by providing drafts of well-written standard messages that you still want to send. For such tasks, it may be useful to have a template for ChatGPT with instructions where you replace certain content every time you generate a message.

**When reading the conversations, consider:**
* What are the advantages and disadvantages of having an AI write messages and texts?
* There is a risk that recipients may feel misled if they believe that a person wrote texts created by an AI. What do you think the reaction will be if the message states that it is formulated by an AI based on instructions from (in this case) teachers at the preschool?
* What recurring needs do you have for writing texts? Try letting ChatGPT write such a text for you and reflect on the results. Can you get the AI to use a language style that you like?

> **I would like you to write a draft of a weekly newsletter for the caretakers of the children at our preschool group, ”Humpty.” The letter should be brief and friendly and tell what we have done during the week.**
> **Things to include in the letter:**
> * **Welcome back after the holiday break**
> * **A new child from the Dumpty group has joined us**
> * **We are going ice skating on Tuesday**
> * **We have continued working on the seasonal tree**
> * **The children have been playing with magnetic bricks a lot**
> * **Next Monday, the preschool will close at 3:45 PM due to staff meeting**
> 
> Subject: Weekly Newsletter from Humpty Preschool Group
> 
> Dear Caretakers,
> 
> We hope this letter finds you well! We wanted to give you a quick update on what has been happening at Humpty this week.
> 
> First, we would like to welcome you back after the holiday break and hope you all had a wonderful time with your families.
> 
> Additionally, we have a new child joining us from the Dumpty group and we are thrilled to have them as part of our community.
> 
> On Tuesday, the children will be going ice skating which should be lots of fun. We are also continuing to work on our seasonal tree and the children have been playing with magnetic bricks, which has been a big hit!
> 
> Just a quick reminder, next Monday, the preschool will be closing at 3:45 PM due to a staff meeting.
> 
> We hope this update gives you a good insight into what has been happening at Humpty and we are looking forward to another great week.
> 
> Best regards,
> Humpty Preschool Group
