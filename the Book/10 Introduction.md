# Part 1: Introduction

# 1: What is ChatGPT?

At first glance, ChatGPT is a chat window where you type messages to a chatbot, which responds to your messages. However, there are several things that make ChatGPT special. The first is that it writes in a human-like manner – it follows the conversation smoothly, writes things that are sensible and is generally friendly. The second thing that makes ChatGPT special is that it has a lot of knowledge even about specific subjects: you can ask about the history of model railroading, what is required for growing potatoes efficiently, or what distinguishes schottische as a dance, and ChatGPT will respond in a clear and credible way.

ChatGPT is powered by an AI model that has been trained on large parts of the text that was available on the internet until 2021. It's more text than a human could read in a lifetime – actually so much that it would require 57 billion human lifetimes to read through it all.[^1] The text is the starting point for the answers that ChatGPT provides, but the answers are not looked up or copied from what the AI model has read. Instead, the text mass has been used to distill patterns for how text and words tend to be related. Based on this, ChatGPT makes guesses on which words would fit well together, and the same question will often result in slightly different answers if asked multiple times. (More information about ChatGPT can be found in Chapter 12.)

This book contains many excerpts from conversations with ChatGPT. A few of them were originally in Swedish and have been translated to English, but still show what conversations with ChatGPT look like. The rest are direct quotes from ChatGPT conversations. The bold text is the question (the "prompt") from the user, the rest is the AI's response. In some cases, the text has been lightly edited for better formatting in book form, and in some cases, larger amounts of text in the question have been replaced by a short description within square brackets.

> **What do you know about the history of model railroading?**
> 
> Model railroading is a popular hobby where people build and operate miniature models of railways and trains. The history of model railroading dates back to the early 1800s, when railways became more common in Europe and North America. At that time, people built models of railways using wood and metal, but it was not until the late 1800s and early 1900s that model railways became a common hobby.
> 
> During the 1920s and 30s, model railroading became more advanced and companies specializing in the manufacture of model trains and railways started to appear. In the US, Lionel and American Flyer were two of the most well-known companies in the model railway industry, while Hornby in the UK was a leading manufacturer in Europe.
> 
> Since then, model railroading has developed a lot, with more detailed models and advanced technology such as digital control and sound and light effects. Today, there are many clubs and organizations around the world that are dedicated to model railroading, and there are also many different types of models to choose from, including scales H0, N and G.
> 
> **Something completely different: Do you know what is required to grow potatoes efficiently?**
> 
> To grow potatoes efficiently, it is important to choose the right variety of potatoes and soil type, and to create the right conditions for the plant to grow in. Here are some important factors to consider:
> 
> 1. Choose the right variety of potatoes: There are many different varieties of potatoes, and some are better suited for growing in certain climates and soils. It is important to choose a variety that is suitable for your area and conditions.
> 2. Soil mixture: Potatoes thrive in soil with high humus content, which is well-drained and has a pH level between 4.8 and 5.5.
> 3. Sowing: Potatoes are often sown in rows with about 50 cm between rows and 30 cm between plants.
> 4. Fertilization: Potatoes need fertilizer with high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium to grow and produce a harvest.
> 5. Watering: Potatoes also need regular watering during their growing period, especially during dry periods.
> 6. Care: Potatoes also require regular care to keep weeds and diseases away.
> 7. Harvest: Potatoes are usually harvested when the leaves on the plant begin to yellow and dry. It is important not to harvest too early as the potatoes have not fully developed yet.
> 8. Storage: Harvested potatoes are best stored in a dark, cool, and dry environment.
> 
> **Thanks! One more thing, by the way: What distinguishes schottische as a dance?**
> 
> 
> The Schottische is a traditional folk dance from Scotland often danced to violin and accordion music. It is known for its fast and lively steps and is usually danced in pairs.
> 
> Some of the key characteristics of the Schottische are:
> 
> * The dance is often in 4/4 time and has a fast and lively rhythm.
> * The Schottische is often danced in pairs, with a leading and a following dancer.
> * The Schottische is known for its fast, lively steps and cuts and jumps.
> * The dance often contains a series of hops and stomping steps, which are characteristic of the Schottische.
> * The Schottische is often danced at folk music festivals and events in Scotland, but is also common at folk dance camps and festivals around the world.
> 
> There are many different variations of the Schottische, and the dance can vary depending on region and tradition. But regardless of where and how it is danced, the Schottische is known for its lively and energetic character.

Starting to use ChatGPT can be overwhelming. Whether you ask questions about cell biology, James Joyce, or the history of Buddhism, it has answers that are delivered clearly. It can summarize texts, write poems, create computer programs, invent bedtime stories, provide feedback and suggestions on drafts, and develop arguments in a conversation with a human. In Chapter 13, you can read more about how tools like ChatGPT could impact our view of knowledge, and of ourselves.

# 2: Four Types of AI Pitfalls

Something that's important to keep in mind right now is that ChatGPT makes mistakes. It does not show in this translation, but the original conversation above, in Swedish, contained a number of misspellings and strange choices of words – often derived from English words. Such Such mistakes are significantly less common in English, since the majority of the text that ChatGPT has been trained on is in English. If you use ChatGPT is a non-English language you are likely to encounter such mistakes, and you will probably notice them right away.

Something that's harder to notice are factual errors – partly because they require relatively good knowledge on the part of the reader, and partly because they are wrapped in a text so clear that the factual content also seems credible. For example, ChatGPT writes that the schottische originated in Scotland, while a reader of schottische on Wikipedia can establish that it probably originated in Bohemia. (This is somewhat supported by Encyclopedia Britannica.)

A couple of other mistakes – if they can be called mistakes – are even harder to discover. ChatGPT says that schottische has a "fast and lively rhythm," while the Swedish Wikipedia article on schottis says it has a "calm tempo." Schottische in other parts of the world seems to have a higher tempo than schottische in Sweden, but this question was (originally) asked in Swedish from a computer in Sweden. Is ChatGPT wrong in saying schottische has fast rhythm? Not really. However, it describes schottische from a perspective that may not be true in Sweden – the country where the question was asked – which makes the answer misleading. Another sort-of-mistake is that the description of the history of model railroading does not mention the manufacturer Märklin (but mentions other manufacturers), despite the fact that Märklin plays a role in the history of model railways and in parts of the world (including in Sweden) is almost synonymous with model railways.

Such sort-of-mistakes are not false, but they reflect a particular aspect of the truth, or cause things to be perceived in a certain way or from a certain perspective. They are difficult to discover, especially for someone who is not vigilant, and risk pushing the recipient into a specific worldview without being aware of it.

The last type of mistake does not deal with what ChatGPT answers, but what you as teacher expect from the answers. The fact that ChatGPT gives you ten well-formulated quiz questions about the Enlightenment does not necessarily mean that it is good pedagogy to use the questions in class: Perhaps the students will learn better from completely different types of activities, or for that matter quiz questions chosen based on what you as a teacher know are common misconceptions or what is particularly important to learn. More serious pedagogical mistakes would be to let ChatGPT create exam assignments or mark student essays without being _very_ careful that what ChatGPT delivers corresponds with what you want (and then one might ask how much help one actually got from the tool).

It is natural and useful to explore different ways to use new tools, and not everything you try needs to work well. But it is easy to overuse powerful tools and make the tool itself the starting point, instead of what you want to use it for.

ChatGPT's versatility and impressive ability to create objective-sounding, clear, and correct messages makes it easy to forget that there is not only artificial intelligence but also artificial stupidity. To make it easier to use ChatGPT with judgement, this book lists four types of AI pitfalls you need to be wary of.

* **Language pitfalls**, such as spelling mistakes and incorrect word choices. These are relatively easy to detect, and rare in the English language. The biggest risk with language mistakes is probably that students may be confused about terminology.
* **Fact pitfalls**, which can also include logical mistakes. Fact errors require subject knowledge to detect, not least because ChatGPT expresses itself in a way that inspires confidence.
* **Perspective and value pitfalls**, where answers from AI may be based on conditions in the United States (or other parts of the world), reinforce stereotypical gender roles, or ignore certain groups in society. Detecting skewed perspectives or values may require both vigilance and deep knowledge.
* **Pedagogical pitfalls**, meaning that what ChatGPT delivers is used without reflecting on whether it actually is useful for your students’ learning.

These types of mistakes are not unique to ChatGPT, and can occur even without the help of technology. And a teacher who has never fallen into these pitfalls probably has not taught at all – and it must be okay to make mistakes. But those who keep the four AI pitfalls in mind will probably find it easier to avoid them.

## Inappropriate Messages

ChatGPT has filters for certain types of messages and language. If you try to get ChatGPT to tell you how to make bombs, mix methamphetamine, or if you want suggestions on how to harass, abuse or torture someone, ChatGPT will respond by saying that it violates its policy to answer. The same applies, for instance, to giving medical advice.

The fact that there are such filters makes ChatGPT a much safer tool, but the filters are not perfect. This means that ChatGPT can sometimes let things slip that it should keep quiet about, and that persistent users can find ways to consistently bypass the filters. (There are, not surprisingly, tips on the internet on how to bypass the filters.)

Most of the tips and ideas in this book assume that it is the teacher who is using ChatGPT, not the student. Of course, it can still happen that students use ChatGPT, in school or outside it, and as a teacher it's good to know that inappropriate messages can pop up.

## Exercises

2. Can you come up with additional categories of AI pitfalls?
3. Review the conversation in chapter 1 again and consider where there may be AI pitfalls.

# 3: Getting Started with ChatGPT

ChatGPT was created and is operated by the company OpenAI. To use ChatGPT, you need an account with OpenAI, which you can set up through the OpenAI website (e.g., [beta.openai.com][2]). The account is free, and although a paid service called ChatGPT Plus was introduced in February, the free service remains accessible. [OpenAI account terms of use][3] state that you must be at least 18 years old. T The email address you provide must be confirmed through an email sent to it, and then you can go to [chat.openai.com][4] and start using ChatGPT.

The key parts of the chat window are (1) the input window for ChatGPT – often called a "prompt", (2) history of previous chats, and (3) the button to start new chat threads. If the selected chat thread is empty, as in the image above, a summary of some of the key features of ChatGPT is displayed.

When you type something to ChatGPT, the conversation appears in the main part of the window. The response from ChatGPT appears word by word, and if the service is under heavy load, it may take a few seconds for the text to appear. (If it times out, just reload the page.) The chat is saved in the left column and automatically gets a header based on its contents.

If you hover over your message to ChatGPT, an icon to edit the question appears, giving a new answer. Next to each answer are buttons that can be used to provide feedback on whether the answer was good or bad, which also give you a chance to indicate what you think would be a perfect answer. Feedback is used to improve ChatGPT.

There is no built-in way to export text from conversations. It's common to either manually mark and copy text or take screenshots, but if you use ChatGPT frequently, you may want to consider installing a plugin in your web browser that makes it easier to copy text.

## Some Tips when Chatting with ChatGPT
Chatting with ChatGPT is natural in many ways - you write as you would to a person. The most common ways are probably to ask short questions or to prompt ChatGPT to write something specific, and follow it up with further questions, prompts or adjustments. Some methods and tricks that may be less natural may also be good to know:

* If you press enter in the chat box, the message will be sent to ChatGPT. With shift + enter, you can create line breaks without sending the message.
* If you want to vary or reuse a longer question, it can save time to have the prompt in a text editor or word processor, where it can be edited, copied and reused more easily.
* If you want to give long texts to ChatGPT, you can for example type "What is the most difficult part of this text?" and paste the text before sending the message, or "Below is a text I have written that I want you to give feedback on so I can improve it."
* If you give ChatGPT a text without any question or instruction, it will respond with a summary of the text.
* ChatGPT is generally faster in answering if written in English, and the messages also contain fewer language errors.
* Detailed descriptions and questions often give more useful answers.
* Follow-up questions are also very useful for clarifying what you want to get out of the answers, or asking ChatGPT to develop parts of the answers that are interesting.
* Some people experiment with long descriptions of how they want ChatGPT to behave. Such descriptions are often ended with something like "confirm that this has been understood by answering 'ok'", and the actual questions or prompts are posted in the next step in the conversation.
* If you want answers in a specific format, such as a bullet point list, table, or a comma-separated list - ask ChatGPT to answer in that format. ChatGPT can sometimes also answer in a format that can be imported directly into certain programs. You can also ask ChatGPT to rewrite answers it has already given in a new form.
* If you find that ChatGPT is slow or limiting, you can try switching to OpenAI Playground at [beta.openai.com/playground][5]. It contains a more flexible (but also more complex) interface to generate AI texts.

It is useful to know that there is a limit to the length of messages to ChatGPT, at about two thousand words, corresponding to or 7–10 pages[^2]. If you want to give ChatGPT longer texts than that, you can try dividing the text, and for example, giving ChatGPT the instruction "I will give you a long text divided into several parts. Here is part 1. Respond 'ok' when you're done."

ChatGPT allows up to 90 seconds for an answer, which can result in long answers being cut off in the middle. In such cases you can type "Can you continue from the last answer and finish it?" or simply "continue", or change the question so that ChatGPT can answer in smaller parts.

There are collections of prompts online that people have found particularly useful. These may include prompts designed specifically for a particular purpose (such as serving as a cookbook or a game master in solo adventures), or groups of prompts that are useful in specific areas (such as assisting computer programmers). If you want to explore such collections, you can try searching for "ChatGPT prompts".

## Exercises

1. If you do not already have an account with OpenAI, create one – provided you agree to their user terms.
2. Try asking questions to ChatGPT or ask ChatGPT to create certain types of texts. Have at least three conversations, where you ask follow-up questions in at least one. At least one of the chats should be about school or education. If you know another language than English, try using that as well.
