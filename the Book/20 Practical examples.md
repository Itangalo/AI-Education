# Part 2: Using ChatGPT in Practice
As described in part 1 of the book, there is every reason to use your judgement to determine whether what ChatGPT writes is suitable for use and, if so, in which parts. Be cautious of the four types of AI pitfalls:

1. Language pitfalls
2. Factual pitfalls
3. Perspective and value pitfalls
4. Pedagogical pitfalls

All these pitfalls are represented in the examples in this part of the book â€“ partly to reflect how responses from ChatGPT look, and partly to make it easier to always use your judgement.
