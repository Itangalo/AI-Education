# 4: Things You Should Not Do

### Do not disclose personal information or other sensitive information
The text written to ChatGPT is sent to servers elsewhere and handled in ways that you do not have control over. This means that no personal information for students or other sensitive information should be given to ChatGPT.

### Do not tell minors to create an OpenAI account
The terms for creating an account with OpenAI, which owns ChatGPT, require that you are at least 18 years old. (See [openai.com/terms][1]). Encouraging students under 18 years of age to obtain an account is therefore inappropriate. For students who are 18 years of age or older, you need to consider what is appropriate when it comes to creating accounts for online services, and it is worth checking if your school has any policy on this.

### Do not use messages from ChatGPT without first reviewing them
It sounds a bit repetitive, but you always need to review and evaluate texts from ChatGPT before they reach your students. In particular, you should not use ChatGPT as an extra teacher, explaining things to students without you as the teacher verifying that what ChatGPT says is okay. The example below can make it clear why this is inappropriate.

> ** What is the probability of rolling a pair with three dice?**
> 
> The probability of rolling a pair with three dice is 11/36 or approximately 0.306.
> 
> ** Can you explain why?**
> 
> Sure! The total number of possible outcomes when rolling three dice is 6 x 6 x 6 = 216. To find the number of outcomes that result in a pair, we can consider the different combinations of values that will result in a pair.
> 
> For example, if the first die shows a "1", then the other two dice must also show a "1" in order for a pair to be rolled. So there is only 1 way to roll a pair when the first die is a "1". Similarly, there is 1 way to roll a pair when the first die is a "2", and so on for each number from 1 to 6.
> 
> Therefore, there are 6 ways to roll a pair with three dice, and the probability is 6/216 = 1/36. But since there are three dice, we need to multiply by 3, giving us 3 x (1/36) = 3/36 = 1/12.
> 
> So the probability of rolling a pair with three dice is 1/12 or approximately 0.083.

In the conversation above, ChatGPT expresses itself clearly and succinctly, and what it says is *incorrect*. (The chance of rolling a pair is a bit more than 40 percent.) When asked, ChatGPT can even justify its answer in a way that sounds good but is inconsistent. *What ChatGPT is good at is sounding like doing math, not actually doing math.* This is an effect of ChatGPT's view of the world beginning and ending with text: It creates text that is consistent with how text typically looks – and it doesn't have to be neither logically consistent nor accurate to the world we humans live in.

A student left to learn from ChatGPT could encounter all sorts of foolishness. At best, the student will be confused by the foolishness and ask the teacher for clarifications. But it is also possible that the student will form misconceptions, without you as a teacher even noticing when it happens, which will lead to difficulties later on.

This example concerns factual errors that are relatively easy to detect, but ChatGPT can throw much more hidden mistakes that can harm students in various ways.

Repeat after me: _ChatGPT is not a teacher or instructor_.

### Don't Trust ChatGPT's References to Research
You can’t rely on the accuracy of the information ChatGPT provides, but you might think that an AI that has read a large portion of the text on the internet in 2021 could suggest research articles to read — so that you yourself can read reliable sources.

ChatGPT cheerfully points to research articles, but the articles mentioned often do not exist. A better option for finding research is, for example, [Google Scholar][2]. (You might also want to try the AI service [typeset.io][3]!)

None of the articles mentioned by ChatGPT below could be found.

> **I would like to learn more about how I as a teacher can help students who feel anxious about giving oral presentations in front of the class. Can you suggest any research articles I can read?**
> 
> Yes, I can give you some suggestions for research articles that can help you learn more about how to help students who feel anxious about giving oral presentations:
> 1. "Preparing Students to Overcome Speech Anxiety: A Review of the Literature" by R. Scott Tannenbaum and Matthew J. Hertenstein. This article provides an overview of various methods that have been shown to be effective in helping students overcome speech anxiety.
> 2. "Self-talk interventions in the classroom: A systematic review" by J. L. McCreary, M. H. Peters, L. L. Perry. This article investigates how teachers can help students use positive self-talk to increase their confidence in speaking.
> 3. "Speech anxiety in the classroom: A review of the literature" by Scott Tannenbaum and Matthew J. Hertenstein. This article provides a detailed overview of various methods that have been shown to be effective in helping students overcome speech anxiety in the school environment.
> 
> You can find these articles via academic search engines like Google Scholar or JSTOR.

> **Can you name a research article on dyslexia that actually exists, along with the name of the person who wrote the article? I don't want you to invent the name of an article, but answer with a published article that actually exists.**
> 
> A research article on dyslexia that actually exists is "The neural basis of dyslexia: a review of recent research" written by F. Paulesu, E. Paulesu, A.F.F. Smith, J.D.E. Raven and L.J. Frith and published in Brain: A Journal of Neurology.
