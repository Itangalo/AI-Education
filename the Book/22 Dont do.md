# 4: Things You Should Not Do

### Do not disclose personal information or other sensitive information
The text written to ChatGPT is sent to servers in other countries and handled in ways that you do not have control over. This means that no personal information for students or other sensitive information should be given to ChatGPT.

### Do not encourage minors to create an OpenAI account
The terms for creating an account with OpenAI, which created ChatGPT, require that you be at least 18 years old. (See [openai.com/terms][1]). Encouraging students under 18 years of age to obtain an account is therefore directly inappropriate. For students who are 18 years of age or older, you need to consider what is appropriate when it comes to obtaining accounts for online services, and it is worth checking if the school has any policy.

### Do not use messages from ChatGPT without first reviewing them
It may be a bit tedious to say it again, but you always need to review and evaluate texts from ChatGPT before they reach the students. In particular, you should not use ChatGPT as an extra teacher, explaining things to students without you as the teacher seeing that what ChatGPT says is okay. The example below can make it clear why this is inappropriate.

> **What is the probability of getting a pair with three dice?**
> 
> The probability of getting a pair with three dice is 1/6 or about 0.17. This is because there are six possible outcomes on a die and you want two of them to be the same number, while the third number can be anything.
> 
> **I don't really understand. Can you explain it more clearly?**
> 
> Let me make sure I understand your question correctly, you want to know the probability of getting a pair with three dice (where two of the dice show the same number and the third is a different number) ?
> 
> To calculate the probability, we need to know the number of possible outcomes that lead to the desired result, and compare it with the total number of possible outcomes.
> 
> There are 6 different numbers on a die (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), so there are 6 possible numbers that the first die can show. For the second die, we also have to choose one of the 6 numbers, but since we already chose a number for the first die, there are only 5 possible numbers left. For the third die, there are 6 possible numbers left to choose.
> 
> So the number of possible outcomes that lead to the desired result (two of the dice show the same number and the third is a different number) is 6 \* 5 \* 6 = 180.
> 
> The total number of possible outcomes is 6 \* 6 \* 6 = 216 (because there are 6 possible numbers for each die).
>
> So the probability of rolling a pair with three dice is 180/216 = 1/6 or roughly 0.17.

In the conversation above, ChatGPT expresses itself clearly and succinctly, and what it says is *incorrect*. (The chance of rolling a pair is over 40 percent.) When asked, ChatGPT can even justify its answer in a way that appears credible but is inconsistent and contains incorrect calculations. *What ChatGPT is good at is sounding like a mathematician, not being a mathematician.* This is an effect of ChatGPT's view of the world beginning and ending with text: It creates text that is consistent with how text typically looks -- and it doesn't have to be either logically consistent or accurate to the world we humans live in.

A student left to learn from ChatGPT could fall into all sorts of foolishness. At best, the student will be confused by the foolishness and ask the teacher. But it is also fully possible that the student will learn inaccuracies, without you as a teacher even noticing when it happens, and that it will create difficulties later.

This example concerns factual errors that are relatively easy to detect, but ChatGPT can throw much more hidden mistakes that can harm students in various ways. ChatGPT is *not* a teacher or instructor.

### Don't Trust ChatGPT's References to Research
Do not rely on the accuracy of the information ChatGPT provides, but one might think that an AI that has read a large portion of the text on the internet in 2021 could suggest research articles to read â€” so that you can find reliable sources.

ChatGPT happily answers such questions, but the articles mentioned are often not to be found. A better option for finding research is, for example, [Google Scholar][2].

None of the articles mentioned by ChatGPT below could be found.

> **I would like to learn more about how I as a teacher can help students who feel anxious about giving oral presentations in front of the class. Can you suggest any research articles I can read?**
> 
> Yes, I can give you some suggestions for research articles that can help you learn more about how to help students who feel anxious about giving oral presentations:
> 1. "Preparing Students to Overcome Speech Anxiety: A Review of the Literature" by R. Scott Tannenbaum and Matthew J. Hertenstein. This article provides an overview of various methods that have been shown to be effective in helping students overcome speech anxiety.
> 2. "Self-talk interventions in the classroom: A systematic review" by J. L. McCreary, M. H. Peters, L. L. Perry. This article investigates how teachers can help students use positive self-talk to increase their confidence in speaking.
> 3. "Speech anxiety in the classroom: A review of the literature" by Scott Tannenbaum and Matthew J. Hertenstein. This article provides a detailed overview of various methods that have been shown to be effective in helping students overcome speech anxiety in the school environment.
> 
> You can find these articles via academic search engines like Google Scholar or JSTOR.

> **Can you name a research article on dyslexia that actually exists, along with the name of the person who wrote the article? I don't want you to invent the name of an article, but answer with a published article that actually exists.**
> 
> A research article on dyslexia that actually exists is "The neural basis of dyslexia: a review of recent research" written by F. Paulesu, E. Paulesu, A.F.F. Smith, J.D.E. Raven and L.J. Frith and published in Brain: A Journal of Neurology.
