# 8: Professional Development and Personal Growth

## Summarize documents to find meaningful reading
By pasting text masses and asking ChatGPT to summarize them, it is possible to get an idea of texts without having to read everything oneself. Of course, information is lost in such a summary, and there is a risk that ChatGPT misses or distorts essential aspects – but it also makes it possible to skim many more documents and choose one or a few texts to read in more detail.

A limitation is that ChatGPT does not accept prompts that are longer than approximately 2000 words. Longer documents can be divided into several steps (see the tips at the end of chapter 3), but it can become impractical for really long texts, and it appears likely that ChatGPT takes less account of things written far back in a chat conversation.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* Do you think ChatGPT's summary below is fair?
* How should one weigh that ChatGPT simplifies and perhaps distorts content against the possibility of overviewing the content of more texts?
* Feel free to let ChatGPT summarize a text you wrote yourself, a long email you received (without sensitive information), or a text you recently read. Do you think it captures the most important part of the text?
* What would happen if students use ChatGPT or similar tools to summarize texts in textbooks or other texts that belong to the teaching?

> **Can you summarize the text below?**
> **[Copy of a text that served as the basis for this book.]**
>  
> The document describes how ChatGPT, an AI model trained to generate text and carry out a dialogue, can be used in school education. It mentions different ways to use ChatGPT in teaching, such as to get ideas for lesson planning or to get feedback on lesson plans, but also warnings that information from ChatGPT must always be reviewed and verified. The document also discusses what information, knowledge, and judgment are and how AI affects the role of teachers and schools. The document also provides examples of use that may be inappropriate and things that are not allowed to be done with ChatGPT in school education.

## Drafts for Evaluations
Instead of using ChatGPT to get answers, you can try using it for getting good questions – or at least inspiration for good questions.

**When you read the conversation, consider:**
* Do you think the questions would work for getting useful feedback from your own students?
* To what extent do you think it is time-saving to get AI-created drafts for evaluations, compared to writing them from scratch yourself?
* How can you balance or combine AI-created evaluations with questions that address specific things you have done in the teaching?

> **I am about to finish teaching a history class and I want to conduct a survey to hear what they think worked well or less well in my teaching. Can you give suggestions for a number of questions that the students won’t answer with just "good" or "don't know," and that will help me improve the teaching for next school year? This is for an 8th-grade class.**
> 
> Sure! Here are some questions that may help you gather useful feedback:
> 
> 1. What topics were your favorite to learn about in this class and why?
> 2. Was the pace of the class too fast or too slow? Why?
> 3. What methods of teaching helped you understand the material best (e.g. lectures, discussions, group projects, etc.)?
> 4. Was there anything that you struggled to understand? Can you give an example?
> 5. Were the class assignments and assessments helpful in reinforcing what you learned? Why or why not?
> 6. How could the class be improved for next year?
> 7. Were there any aspects of the class that you found particularly engaging or interesting?
> 8. Was there anything you would have liked to learn more about in this class?
> 9. Were the class materials (textbook, videos, etc.) helpful in understanding the subject matter?
> 10. Are there any suggestions you have for making the class more interactive or hands-on?
> 
> Note that it's important to let the students know that their feedback is valued and that their answers will be kept confidential. This may encourage them to be more honest and thoughtful in their responses.

## Develop Forms for Collaborative Learning
Even though ChatGPT can provide inspiration for teaching, it is often more rewarding to discuss teaching with people in meat space. ChatGPT can provide suggestions for this, too.

**When reading the conversations, consider:**
* Could the suggestions be useful at your school?
* What follow-up questions would you like to ask, with details about the conditions at your school?

> **Can you give five suggestions on how the faculty at my elementary school can establish routines for discussing and sharing examples of how we teach, so that we can develop our work?**
> 
> 1. Schedule regular meetings: Establish a regular meeting schedule for faculty to come together and discuss teaching strategies, best practices, and share examples.
> 2. Create a discussion forum: Encourage the use of online discussion forums or groups where faculty can share and exchange ideas, resources and best practices with each other.
> 3. Foster a culture of collaboration: Encourage teachers to work together on projects and assignments, allowing them to share their teaching methods and learn from one another.
> 4. Use technology: Utilize technology such as videoconferencing, screen sharing and collaborative documents to facilitate discussions and share examples of teaching practices.
> 5. Encourage reflection: Encourage faculty to reflect on their teaching practices and engage in regular self-assessment. Provide opportunities for teachers to observe one another's classrooms and give feedback, promoting a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

---- 

> **Can you suggest ideas on how teachers and school management at my school can create common goals for teaching, which we actually can work towards? It is a high school with approximately 50 teachers, a principal, and an assistant principal. Teachers feel that school management is not engaged in improving the quality of teaching.**
> 
> Sure, here are some ideas that can help create common goals for teaching at your high school:
> 
> 1. Conduct a survey: Ask teachers and school management to identify areas where they feel the school needs improvement.
> 2. Hold focus groups: Gather teachers and school management to discuss their thoughts and ideas on common goals.
> 3. Set clear and realistic goals: Make sure the goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) so everyone can work towards them.
> 4. Encourage collaboration: Foster a culture of teamwork and open communication between teachers and school management.
> 5. Establish regular check-ins: Schedule regular meetings to assess progress towards the common goals and make necessary adjustments.
> 6. Reward progress: Recognize and reward progress towards the common goals, which can encourage continued effort.
> 7. Foster a culture of continuous improvement: Encourage teachers and school management to continuously strive for better outcomes and to be open to constructive feedback.
> 8. Involve the whole school community: Encourage students, parents, and other stakeholders to participate in the goal-setting process and engage with the common goals.
> 9. Keep the goals aligned with the school's mission and vision: Make sure that the common goals align with the overall purpose of the school and support the school's mission and vision.

## ChatGPT as Writing Coach
ChatGPT can provide feedback on texts, thereby giving ideas on how to become a better writer. This method is primarily suitable for teachers, not students, as it requires assessing the suggestions given by AI (as not all suggestions are necessarily successful or worth putting much effort into).

Note that this example for using ChatGPT aims to develop writing skills, not primarily to get a well-written text. The focus is therefore on the feedback and its usefulness.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* Does ChatGPT provide meaningful feedback to develop the language in the article?
* Would you like to have coaching from an AI yourself? Why or why not?
* Are there other areas related to your work that you think ChatGPT could serve as a coach?

> **Below is a text I’ve written on the background of ChatGPT. Can you give me suggestions on how I can improve my writing style?**
> **[Embedded text from chapter 12.]**
>  
> Here are some suggestions to improve your writing style:
> 
> Strengths:
> 
> * You provide a clear explanation of the background of ChatGPT and its AI model, GPT-3.5.
> * You mention relevant details such as the number of users, the development of AI for images, and the comparison of ChatGPT with other AI services.
> * You give a sense of the value of large AI models, their development process, and the companies involved.
> 
> Weaknesses:
> 
> * Your writing is often repetitive and lacks variety in sentence structure.
> * The language can be dense and technical, making it difficult for the reader to follow.
> * You include several parenthetical statements, which can be disruptive to the flow of the text.
> * You could benefit from providing more context or background information on terms and concepts that are not commonly known to the reader.
> 
> General suggestions:
> 
> * Consider using shorter, simpler sentences to make the information more accessible.
> * Try to use descriptive language and avoid excessive use of technical terms.
> * Use subheadings, bullet points, or other formatting elements to break up the text and make it easier to follow.
> * Consider rearranging the information to build a more cohesive narrative.
> * Use concrete examples to illustrate key concepts, making them more memorable and easier to understand.
> 
> ** Thanks! (I think.) Do you have any suggestions for how I can become better at using a more varied sentence structure?**
> 
> Certainly! Here are some tips to help you use a more varied sentence structure:
> 
> 1. Mix short and long sentences: Alternate between short, simple sentences and longer, more complex ones to maintain reader engagement and interest.
> 2. Use different sentence starters: Start sentences with different words and phrases, such as clauses, prepositional phrases, and gerunds, to add variety and interest.
> 3. Vary sentence length: Avoid using only one type of sentence length. Experiment with varying the length of your sentences to add rhythm and interest.
> 4. Use active voice: Write in the active voice rather than passive voice, as it makes sentences livelier and more engaging.
> 5. Experiment with sentence structures: Play with sentence structures, such as compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences, to add variety and interest.
> 6. Read widely: Read different types of writing to become familiar with different sentence structures and techniques.
> 7. Practice writing: Practice writing in different styles, using a variety of sentence structures, to help you develop your own style and become more confident with using a varied sentence structure.
> 8. Get feedback: Share your writing with others and seek feedback on how to improve your sentence structure. This can help you identify areas for improvement and develop your skills over time.

## Ideas for Technical Tools and How to Use Them
ChatGPT can provide suggestions on how to perform tricky or uncommon tasks, and can also provide guidance on navigating some well-known programs to get the job done.

**When reading the conversations, consider:**
* What are the pros and cons of asking ChatGPT compared to searching the internet? Compared to asking a colleague or IT support?

> **Do you have ideas for programs or apps that I can use to save time when providing feedback on student essays? (Ideas that don't involve programs or apps are also okay.)**
> 
> Here are a few suggestions:
> 1. Grammarly: This app can help you identify grammatical errors and suggest improvements in writing. It can save time in the editing process, allowing you to focus on more in-depth feedback.
> 2. Google Docs: This online word processing program allows you to provide comments and suggestions in real-time, making it easy to collaborate with others and give quick feedback to students.
> 3. Rubric-based grading: Develop a set of criteria for grading essays and use a rubric to quickly and consistently evaluate student work. This will also help students understand what they need to do to improve their writing.
> 4. Audio or video feedback: Consider using audio or video feedback to provide more personal and engaging feedback to students. This can be done using tools like Flipgrid or Explain Everything.
> 5. Highlighting and commenting tools: Utilize the highlighting and commenting tools in word processing software, such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs, to quickly and efficiently provide feedback on specific areas of an essay.
> 
> Note that these are just a few examples and the best tool for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences.

> **Me and my colleagues work together on a number of documents, which we email to each other when we make updates. It becomes difficult to know which is the latest version and we have several times lost changes that someone has made. Can you suggest any other method for collaborating on documents?**
>  
> Yes, there are several alternatives to emailing updated documents that can make collaboration easier and prevent the loss of changes. Some options are:
> 1. Cloud-based document collaboration tools: Services like Google Docs, Microsoft OneDrive, and Dropbox allow multiple users to access and edit the same document in real-time, with the ability to track changes and revert to earlier versions.
> 2. Project management software: Tools such as Asana, Trello, and Monday.com offer document collaboration features as part of their project management suite, allowing teams to share and track the progress of their work.
> 3. Version control systems: For software development teams, version control systems such as Git provide a way to manage changes to source code and track the progress of a project.
> 
> You can choose the option that best fits your needs and start collaborating more effectively on your documents.
>  
> **We are not allowed to use any cloud services at my school. Do you have any other tips?**
>  
> Yes, here are some alternatives to cloud services that you can use at your school:
> 1. Network shared drive: You can create a shared network drive where all team members have access to the latest version of the document. This eliminates the need to email the document back and forth.
> 2. File synchronization software: Tools like BitTorrent Sync, Resilio Sync, and Syncthing allow you to synchronize files between multiple devices without the need for a central server.
> 3. Local version control systems: If you're working on text-based files, you can use a local version control system such as Git to track changes and revert to earlier versions if needed.
> 4. USB drives: You can also use physical storage like USB drives to transfer the latest version of the document between team members.
> 
> By using one of these options, you can collaborate on documents more effectively and avoid losing changes.

> 2. Right-click on the calendar you want to share and select "Share Calendar."
> 3. In the "Share Calendar" window, enter the email address of the person you want to share the calendar with.
> 4. Select the level of detail you want to share (e.g. availability only, full details).
> 5. Optionally, you can add a message to accompany the calendar invitation.
> 6. Click "Send."
> 
> The recipient will receive an email with a link to your calendar. They will be able to view it in their own Outlook calendar or in a web browser if they don't have Outlook. Note that the recipient will only be able to see updates to the calendar if you continue to share it with them.

---- 

> **Do you have suggestions for programs that can be used to convert handwritten mathematical text to computer text?**
> There are a few options for converting handwritten mathematical text to computer text:
> 1. MyScript Calculator - a handwriting recognition software that can recognize mathematical equations and convert them into digital text.
> 2. Mathpix Snip - a tool that uses OCR technology to recognize mathematical equations and convert them into LaTeX, a typesetting language for mathematics.
> 3. Microsoft OneNote - a note-taking program that has handwriting recognition features that can convert handwritten equations into editable text.
> 4. Ink2Text - a free web-based tool that can convert handwritten equations into digital text using OCR technology.

> **How can I analyze an mp3 file with music to find the most common frequencies in the song?**
> 
> To analyze an MP3 file to find the most common frequencies in a song, you can do the following steps:
> 1. Convert the MP3 file to a WAV file: MP3 is a lossy compression format and may not contain the full frequency range of the original audio. Converting the MP3 file to WAV will ensure that the audio information is preserved.
> 2. Perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the WAV file: FFT is a mathematical operation that transforms a time-domain signal into a frequency-domain signal, which represents the different frequencies present in the audio.
> 3. Plot the frequency spectrum: The result of the FFT can be plotted as a frequency spectrum, where the vertical axis represents the magnitude of each frequency component, and the horizontal axis represents the frequency. The frequency components with the highest magnitudes will represent the most common frequencies in the song.
> 
> There are many software tools that can perform these steps, such as Audacity, MATLAB, or Python libraries like Numpy and Matplotlib. You can use any of these tools to perform the analysis and visualize the frequency spectrum.

## Encourage and Motivate Yourself
Even in teaching, one may occasionally need some extra encouragement. ChatGPT can, to some extent, help here as well. (In the second example, the prompt is a modification of a prompt on the prompts.chat [prompts.chat][1] page.)

**As you read the conversations, consider:**
* Does ChatGPT provide meaningful encouragement? Would you benefit from similar encouragement?
* What happens if AI becomes nearly as good as people in encouraging and creating motivation?

> **I have more than 60 tests from my students to mark, and I find it difficult to find motivation. Can you write a nice text about me, so that I feel encouraged and understand how good I will feel when I'm done with the tests?**
> 
> Of course! Here you go:
> 
> "Dear [Your Name],
> 
> You are a true shining star in the field of education. Your dedication to your students and their learning is truly inspiring. It takes a special kind of person to pour so much time and effort into grading 60+ tests, but you are more than up to the task.
> 
> The feeling of accomplishment that you will experience once you've completed marking all of these tests will be immense. You will have taken an important step in helping your students grow and succeed, and that is something to be truly proud of.
> 
> So take a deep breath, focus on the task at hand, and remember that you are making a difference in the lives of your students. The hard work that you are putting in today will pay off in ways you can't even imagine, and you will feel a sense of satisfaction like no other.
> 
> You've got this! Keep up the fantastic work."

---- 
> **I want you to act as a motivational coach. I will provide you with some information about someone’s goals and challenges, and it will be your job to come up with strategies that can help this person achieve their goals. This could involve providing positive affirmations, giving helpful advice or suggesting activities they can do to reach their end goal. My first request is “I need help motivating myself to stay disciplined while marking a large number of exams”.**
> 
> Here are some strategies that may help you stay motivated and disciplined while marking a large number of exams:
> 1. Break up the task into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about marking all the exams at once, focus on completing a set number of exams each day.
> 2. Set specific, measurable goals for yourself. For example, "I will mark 50 exams by the end of the week."
> 3. Use a timer to stay on task. Set a timer for a specific amount of time, and make sure to stay focused on the task at hand until the timer goes off.
> 4. Reward yourself for making progress. When you reach a goal or complete a certain number of exams, give yourself a small reward, such as a break or a treat.
> 5. Keep a positive attitude and remind yourself of the importance of your work. Marking exams is an important task that contributes to the education of students.
> 6. Create a conducive environment for working, free from distractions and comfortable.
> 7. Take breaks in between, move around, and stretch your body to avoid burnout.
> 8. Lastly, keep in mind that discipline and motivation are skills that can be developed over time. The more you practice, the more natural it will become.
> 
> **I have now marked seven exams and feel like doing something else. Can you cheer me up so I get the energy to do seven more?**
> 
> Of course! Here are some ways you can boost your motivation and energy to keep going:
> 1. Remind yourself of your goals and why they are important to you.
> 2. Take a short break and do something you enjoy, like listening to your favorite music or taking a quick walk outside.
> 3. Make a list of all the benefits you'll receive from completing the task, such as a sense of accomplishment, the satisfaction of a job well done, and the ability to take the next step in your career.
> 4. Try to change your perspective about the task, instead of marking exams, think of it as an opportunity to help students achieve their goals.
> 5. Positive affirmations can also be helpful in this situation, try saying something like "I am capable and strong, I can do this."
> 6. If you are feeling low on energy, try drinking some water or eating a healthy snack to boost your energy levels.
> 7. Lastly, try to focus on the progress you've made so far and remember that every exam you mark is one step closer to completing the task.
> 
> Remember, motivation and energy can fluctuate, but you have the power to control your thoughts and actions. You can do this!
