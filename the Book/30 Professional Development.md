# 8: Professional Development and Personal Growth

## Summarize documents to find meaningful reading
By pasting text masses and asking ChatGPT to summarize them, it is possible to get an idea of texts without having to read everything oneself. Of course, information is lost in such a summary, and there is a risk that ChatGPT misses or distorts essential aspects – but it also makes it possible to skim many more documents and choose one or a few texts to read in more detail.

A limitation is that ChatGPT does not accept prompts that are longer than approximately 2000 words. Longer documents can be divided into several steps (see the tips at the end of chapter 3), but it can become impractical for really long texts, and it appears likely that ChatGPT takes less account of things written far back in a chat conversation.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* Do you think ChatGPT's summary below is fair?
* How should one weigh that ChatGPT simplifies and perhaps distorts content against the possibility of overviewing the content of more texts?
* Feel free to let ChatGPT summarize a text you wrote yourself, a long email you received (without sensitive information), or a text you recently read. Do you think it captures the most important part of the text?
* What would happen if students use ChatGPT or similar tools to summarize texts in textbooks or other texts that belong to the teaching?

> **Can you summarize the text below?**
> **[Copy of a text that served as the basis for this book.]**
>  
> The document describes how ChatGPT, an AI model trained to generate text and carry out a dialogue, can be used in school education. It mentions different ways to use ChatGPT in teaching, such as to get ideas for lesson planning or to get feedback on lesson plans, but also warnings that information from ChatGPT must always be reviewed and verified. The document also discusses what information, knowledge, and judgment are and how AI affects the role of teachers and schools. The document also provides examples of use that may be inappropriate and things that are not allowed to be done with ChatGPT in school education.

## Drafts for Evaluations
Instead of using ChatGPT to get answers, you can try using it for getting good questions – or at least inspiration for good questions.

**When you read the conversation, consider:**
* Do you think the questions would work for getting useful feedback from your own students?
* To what extent do you think it is time-saving to get AI-created drafts for evaluations, compared to writing them from scratch yourself?
* How can you balance or combine AI-created evaluations with questions that address specific things you have done in the teaching?

> **I am about to finish teaching a history class and I want to conduct a survey to hear what they think worked well or less well in my teaching. Can you give suggestions for a number of questions that the students won’t answer with just "good" or "don't know," and that will help me improve the teaching for next school year? This is for an 8th-grade class.**
> 
> Sure! Here are some questions that may help you gather useful feedback:
> 
> 1. What topics were your favorite to learn about in this class and why?
> 2. Was the pace of the class too fast or too slow? Why?
> 3. What methods of teaching helped you understand the material best (e.g. lectures, discussions, group projects, etc.)?
> 4. Was there anything that you struggled to understand? Can you give an example?
> 5. Were the class assignments and assessments helpful in reinforcing what you learned? Why or why not?
> 6. How could the class be improved for next year?
> 7. Were there any aspects of the class that you found particularly engaging or interesting?
> 8. Was there anything you would have liked to learn more about in this class?
> 9. Were the class materials (textbook, videos, etc.) helpful in understanding the subject matter?
> 10. Are there any suggestions you have for making the class more interactive or hands-on?
> 
> Note that it's important to let the students know that their feedback is valued and that their answers will be kept confidential. This may encourage them to be more honest and thoughtful in their responses.

## Develop Forms for Collaborative Learning
Even though ChatGPT can provide inspiration for teaching, it is often more rewarding to discuss teaching with people in meat space. ChatGPT can provide suggestions for this, too.

**When reading the conversations, consider:**
* Could the suggestions be useful at your school?
* What follow-up questions would you like to ask, with details about the conditions at your school?

> **Can you give five suggestions on how the faculty at my elementary school can establish routines for discussing and sharing examples of how we teach, so that we can develop our work?**
> 
> 1. Schedule regular meetings: Establish a regular meeting schedule for faculty to come together and discuss teaching strategies, best practices, and share examples.
> 2. Create a discussion forum: Encourage the use of online discussion forums or groups where faculty can share and exchange ideas, resources and best practices with each other.
> 3. Foster a culture of collaboration: Encourage teachers to work together on projects and assignments, allowing them to share their teaching methods and learn from one another.
> 4. Use technology: Utilize technology such as videoconferencing, screen sharing and collaborative documents to facilitate discussions and share examples of teaching practices.
> 5. Encourage reflection: Encourage faculty to reflect on their teaching practices and engage in regular self-assessment. Provide opportunities for teachers to observe one another's classrooms and give feedback, promoting a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

---- 

> **Can you suggest ideas on how teachers and school management at my school can create common goals for teaching, which we actually can work towards? It is a high school with approximately 50 teachers, a principal, and an assistant principal. Teachers feel that school management is not engaged in improving the quality of teaching.**
> 
> Sure, here are some ideas that can help create common goals for teaching at your high school:
> 
> 1. Conduct a survey: Ask teachers and school management to identify areas where they feel the school needs improvement.
> 2. Hold focus groups: Gather teachers and school management to discuss their thoughts and ideas on common goals.
> 3. Set clear and realistic goals: Make sure the goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) so everyone can work towards them.
> 4. Encourage collaboration: Foster a culture of teamwork and open communication between teachers and school management.
> 5. Establish regular check-ins: Schedule regular meetings to assess progress towards the common goals and make necessary adjustments.
> 6. Reward progress: Recognize and reward progress towards the common goals, which can encourage continued effort.
> 7. Foster a culture of continuous improvement: Encourage teachers and school management to continuously strive for better outcomes and to be open to constructive feedback.
> 8. Involve the whole school community: Encourage students, parents, and other stakeholders to participate in the goal-setting process and engage with the common goals.
> 9. Keep the goals aligned with the school's mission and vision: Make sure that the common goals align with the overall purpose of the school and support the school's mission and vision.

## ChatGPT as Writing Coach
ChatGPT can provide feedback on texts, thereby giving ideas on how to become a better writer. This method is primarily suitable for teachers, not students, as it requires assessing the suggestions given by AI (as not all suggestions are necessarily successful or worth putting much effort into).

Note that this example for using ChatGPT aims to develop writing skills, not primarily to get a well-written text. The focus is therefore on the feedback and its usefulness.

**When reading the conversation, consider:**
* Does ChatGPT provide meaningful feedback to develop the language in the article?
* Would you like to have coaching from an AI yourself? Why or why not?
* Are there other areas related to your work that you think ChatGPT could serve as a coach?

> **Below is a text I’ve written on the background of ChatGPT. Can you give me suggestions on how I can improve my writing style?**
> **[Embedded text from chapter 12.]**
>  
> Here are some suggestions to improve your writing style:
> 
> Strengths:
> 
> * You provide a clear explanation of the background of ChatGPT and its AI model, GPT-3.5.
> * You mention relevant details such as the number of users, the development of AI for images, and the comparison of ChatGPT with other AI services.
> * You give a sense of the value of large AI models, their development process, and the companies involved.
> 
> Weaknesses:
> 
> * Your writing is often repetitive and lacks variety in sentence structure.
> * The language can be dense and technical, making it difficult for the reader to follow.
> * You include several parenthetical statements, which can be disruptive to the flow of the text.
> * You could benefit from providing more context or background information on terms and concepts that are not commonly known to the reader.
> 
> General suggestions:
> 
> * Consider using shorter, simpler sentences to make the information more accessible.
> * Try to use descriptive language and avoid excessive use of technical terms.
> * Use subheadings, bullet points, or other formatting elements to break up the text and make it easier to follow.
> * Consider rearranging the information to build a more cohesive narrative.
> * Use concrete examples to illustrate key concepts, making them more memorable and easier to understand.
> 
> ** Thanks! (I think.) Do you have any suggestions for how I can become better at using a more varied sentence structure?**
> 
> Certainly! Here are some tips to help you use a more varied sentence structure:
> 
> 1. Mix short and long sentences: Alternate between short, simple sentences and longer, more complex ones to maintain reader engagement and interest.
> 2. Use different sentence starters: Start sentences with different words and phrases, such as clauses, prepositional phrases, and gerunds, to add variety and interest.
> 3. Vary sentence length: Avoid using only one type of sentence length. Experiment with varying the length of your sentences to add rhythm and interest.
> 4. Use active voice: Write in the active voice rather than passive voice, as it makes sentences livelier and more engaging.
> 5. Experiment with sentence structures: Play with sentence structures, such as compound, complex, and compound-complex sentences, to add variety and interest.
> 6. Read widely: Read different types of writing to become familiar with different sentence structures and techniques.
> 7. Practice writing: Practice writing in different styles, using a variety of sentence structures, to help you develop your own style and become more confident with using a varied sentence structure.
> 8. Get feedback: Share your writing with others and seek feedback on how to improve your sentence structure. This can help you identify areas for improvement and develop your skills over time.

## Technical Tools and How to Use Them
ChatGPT can provide suggestions on how to perform tricky or uncommon tasks and can also provide guidance on navigating well-known programs to get the job done.

**When reading the conversations, consider:**
* What are the pros and cons of asking ChatGPT compared to searching the internet? Compared to asking a colleague or IT support?

> **Do you have tips on programs or apps that I can use to provide feedback on essays in a time-saving manner? (Tips that don't involve programs or apps are also okay.)**
> There are several programs and apps that can help you provide feedback on essays in a time-saving manner. Here are some suggestions:
> 1. Grammarly: This is an online tool that can help you identify grammar mistakes, spelling errors and sentence structure issues. It can also be used to check the tone of the text.
> 2. Hemingway: This tool helps you make text easier to read by identifying difficult words, long sentences, and complex sentence structures.
> 3. Turnitin: This program can help you check for similarities between the essay and other previously published texts.
> 4. Google Docs: This tool makes it easy to collaborate with others and provide feedback on essays in real-time.
> 5. Feedback Studio from Turnitin: Easy to use, provides the ability to add comments, draw, create headings, mark and comment on text and images.
> 6. If there is no program or app that suits you, you can also provide feedback the traditional way, write it down on paper or write it down in a regular word processing program.

> **Me and my colleagues work together on a number of documents, which we email to each other when we make updates. It becomes difficult to know which is the latest version and we have several times lost changes that someone has made. Can you suggest any other method for collaborating on documents?**
>  
> A good way to collaborate on documents is to use a cloud-based document management and collaboration service. Services like Google Docs, Microsoft Office 365, and Dropbox Paper provide the ability to create, edit, and share documents in real-time with multiple users. These services automatically save all changes and make it easy to view previous versions of a document and restore previous changes if needed. These services also have features for comments, markings, and revision management, making it easier to collaborate and keep track of changes.
>  
> **We are not allowed to use any cloud services at my school. Do you have any other tips?**
>  
> Without access to cloud services, there are still a number of ways to collaborate on documents:
> 1. Share the document via email: This can be done by attaching the document to an email message and sending it to those who will collaborate. This is not the most efficient method, however, as it can be difficult to keep track of which version is the latest.
> 2. Use a shared folder on the school network: This makes it possible for everyone in the group to save and retrieve the document from the same place. This does require that everyone has access to the network.
> 3. Use version control software like Git: This is a tool for keeping track of changes in code, but it can also be used to keep track of changes in regular documents. This does require some technical competence.
> 4. Use a shared editing tool: There are a number of tools that offer real-time editing of documents with multiple users, such as Etherpad, OnlyOffice.
> 5. Use a shared calendar tool: There are a number of tools that offer the ability to create and share calendars with multiple users. This makes it possible for everyone in the group to see when a document is due and who is responsible for what.

---- 

> **How do I share my Outlook calendar with someone outside of our school?**
> 
> To share your Outlook calendar with someone outside of your school, follow these steps:
> 1. Open Outlook and click on "Calendar" in the navigation bar at the bottom.
> 2. Click on the "Shared calendars" tab and select "Add calendar," then select "from the Internet."
> 3. Enter the email address of the person you want to share your calendar with and click "OK."
> 4. An invitation will be sent to the person to accept your calendar. Once they have accepted, they will be able to see your calendar.
> 
> Note that there may be different calendar sharing settings, depending on your organization, so there may be additional steps or the option may not be available. Contact your IT department for more information on how to share your calendar.

---- 

> **Do you have suggestions for programs that can be used to convert handwritten mathematical text to computer text?**
> Yes, there are a number of programs that can convert handwritten mathematical text to computer text. One example is MyScript Calculator, which is an app that can convert handwritten mathematical expressions to digital text and then solve them. You can also try Mathpix Snip, which is a screenshot service that can convert screenshots of mathematical expressions to digital text. Other options include Graphical User Interface (GUI) based tools like Mathematica and Maple, both of which have features for solving and visualizing mathematical problems.

---- 

> **How can I analyze an mp3 file with music to find the most common frequencies in the song?**
> There are different ways to analyze an MP3 file to find the most common frequencies in the song. One way to do this is to use a computer software that is specifically designed to analyze sound files. Many such programs can be downloaded for free from the internet, and most of them provide a visual representation of the sound spectrum in the form of a color-coded diagram or a spectrum diagram. You can also use a sound editing program such as Audacity to analyze the sound file. In Audacity, you can use the "Analyze \> Plot Spectrum" tool to get a visualization of the frequency distribution in the song.
> Another way to analyze an MP3 file to find the most common frequencies is to use a sound frequency analyzer. These analyzers are electronic devices that can measure and analyze different sound frequencies in real-time. You can connect an analyzer to your computer and play the song through it, and then the analyzer will measure and display the various frequencies in the song. Sound frequency analyzers are available to purchase in different price ranges and with different functions and precision.
> Regardless of which way you choose to analyze the song, you will be able to see which frequencies are most common in the song and how they are distributed over the different parts of the song. You can also see if there are any special frequencies or tones that recur throughout the song. By analyzing the song in this way, you can get a deeper understanding of how the song is built and what elements give it its character.

## Encourage and Motivate Yourself
Even in teaching, one may occasionally need some extra encouragement and motivation that wavers. ChatGPT can, to some extent, help here as well. (In the second example, the prompt is a modification of a prompt on the prompts.chat [prompts.chat][1] page.)

**As you read the conversations, consider:**
* Does ChatGPT provide meaningful encouragement? Would you benefit from similar encouragement?
* What happens if AI becomes nearly as good as people in encouraging and creating motivation?

> ** I have more than 60 tests from my students to go through, and I find it difficult to find motivation. Can you write a nice text about me, so that I feel encouraged and understand how good I will feel when I'm done with the tests?**
> Hello! Going through all of your students' tests sounds like a big and time-consuming task. It can be difficult to find motivation in such a situation, but I want to encourage you to keep going.
> Think about all of the students you will help by giving feedback on their tests. You will contribute to their learning and help them improve. It's an important and meaningful task that you have taken on.
> When you are done with the tests, you will feel proud of having completed this task and done your best for your students. You will also feel a great sense of satisfaction when you see how much you have contributed to their learning.
> So keep going, continue to take it one step at a time, and remember that what you are doing is important and meaningful. You will feel proud and satisfied when you are done!

---- 
> ** I want you to act as a motivational coach. I will provide you with some information about someone’s goals and challenges, and it will be your job to come up with strategies that can help this person achieve their goals. This could involve providing positive affirmations, giving helpful advice or suggesting activities they can do to reach their end goal. My first request is “I need help motivating myself to stay disciplined while marking a large number of exams”.**
> Here are some strategies that may help you stay motivated and disciplined while marking a large number of exams:
> 1. Break up the task into smaller, manageable chunks. Instead of thinking about marking all the exams at once, focus on completing a set number of exams each day.
> 2. Set specific, measurable goals for yourself. For example, "I will mark 50 exams by the end of the week."
> 3. Use a timer to stay on task. Set a timer for a specific amount of time, and make sure to stay focused on the task at hand until the timer goes off.
> 4. Reward yourself for making progress. When you reach a goal or complete a certain number of exams, give yourself a small reward, such as a break or a treat.
> 5. Keep a positive attitude and remind yourself of the importance of your work. Marking exams is an important task that contributes to the education of students.
> 6. Create a conducive environment for working, free from distractions and comfortable.
> 7. Take breaks in between, move around, and stretch your body to avoid burnout.
> 8. Lastly, keep in mind that discipline and motivation are skills that can be developed over time. The more you practice, the more natural it will become.
> ** I have now marked seven exams and feel like doing something else. Can you cheer me up so I get the energy to do seven more?**
> Of course! Here are some ways you can boost your motivation and energy to keep going:
> 1. Remind yourself of your goals and why they are important to you.
> 2. Take a short break and do something you enjoy, like listening to your favorite music or taking a quick walk outside.
> 3. Make a list of all the benefits you'll receive from completing the task, such as a sense of accomplishment, the satisfaction of a job well done, and the ability to take the next step in your career.
> 4. Try to change your perspective about the task, instead of marking exams, think of it as an opportunity to help students achieve their goals.
> 5. Positive affirmations can also be helpful in this situation, try saying something like "I am capable and strong, I can do this."
> 6. If you are feeling low on energy, try drinking some water or eating a healthy snack to boost your energy levels.
> 7. Lastly, try to focus on the progress you've made so far and remember that every exam you mark is one step closer to completing the task.
> Remember, motivation and energy can fluctuate, but you have the power to control your thoughts and actions. You can do this!
